		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And God said, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And God said, "Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear"; and it was so.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called He Seas; and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth"; and it was so.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind; and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And the evening and the morning were the third day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And God said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth"; and it was so.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He made the stars also.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And God said, "Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And God created great whales and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind; and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply on the earth."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And God said, "Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind"; and it was so.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind; and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And God said, "Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> So God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> And God blessed them, and God said unto them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> And God said, "Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat"; and it was so.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> And God saw every thing that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He had rested from all His work which God created and made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> and before every plant of the field was in the earth, and before every herb of the field grew; for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He put the man whom He had formed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from thence it was parted and became four heads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> The name of the first is Pishon; that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And the gold of that land is good, and there is bdellium and the onyx stone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And the name of the second river is Gihon; the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And the name of the third river is Hiddekel; that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And the LORD God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it. For in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And the LORD God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper meet for him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air, and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them; and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a helper meet for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And the rib which the LORD God had taken from man, made He a woman and brought her unto the man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And Adam said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall be one flesh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, "Yea, hath God said, `Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And the woman said unto the serpent, "We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, `Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it,lest ye die.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And the serpent said unto the woman, "Ye shall not surely die;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof and ate, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he ate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves things to gird about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And they heard the voice of the LORD God, walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And the LORD God called unto Adam and said unto him, "Where art thou?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And he said, "I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And He said, "Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And the man said, "The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And the LORD God said unto the woman, "What is this that thou hast done?" And the woman said, "The serpent beguiled me, and I ate."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And the LORD God said unto the serpent, "Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field. Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her Seed; It shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise His heel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Unto the woman He said, "I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception. In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And unto Adam He said, "Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, `Thou shalt not eat of it,' cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And the LORD God said, "Behold, the man has become as one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat and live for ever"--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived and bore Cain, and said, "I have gotten a man from the LORD."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And Abel also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> but unto Cain and to his offering He had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And the LORD said unto Cain, "Why art thou wroth? And why is thy countenance fallen?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And the LORD said unto Cain, "Where is Abel thy brother?" And he said, "I know not. Am I my brother's keeper?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And He said, "What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto Me from the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength. A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be on the earth."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And Cain said unto the LORD, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Behold, Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth, and from Thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth. And it shall come to pass that every one who findeth me shall slay me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And the LORD said unto him, "Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold." And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod to the east of Eden.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And unto Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents, and of those who have cattle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And his brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who handle the harp and organ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron; and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And Lamech said unto his wives, "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech! For I have slain a man for my wounding, and a young man for my hurt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And Adam knew his wife again; and she bore a son and called his name Seth. "For God," said she, "hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And to Seth also there was born a son, and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were fair; and they took for themselves wives of all whom they chose.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And the LORD said, "My Spirit shall not always strive with man, for he also is flesh; yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> There were giants on the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men and they bore children to them, the same became mighty men who were of old, men of renown.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagining of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And the LORD repented that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved Him in His heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And the LORD said, "I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast, and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air, for I repent that I have made them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="16"> A window shalt thou make for the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under heaven; and every thing that is on the earth shall die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> But with thee will I establish My covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife and thy sons' wives with thee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee to keep them alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be food for thee and for them."</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And the LORD said unto Noah, "Come thou and all thy house into the ark, for thee have I seen righteous before Me in this generation.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4"> For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> there went in two by two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female as God had commanded Noah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, that same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> they, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two by two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him; and the LORD shut him in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And the flood was forty days upon the earth, and the waters increased and bore up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark went upon the face of the waters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth, and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail, and the mountains were covered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl and of cattle and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> all in whose nostrils was the breath of life, all that was on the dry land, died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle, and the creeping things and the fowl of the heaven, and they were destroyed from the earth. And Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark; and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters were assuaged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And the waters returned from off the earth continually, and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11"> And Abraham said, "Because I thought surely the fear of God is not in this place, and they will slay me for my wife's sake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And yet indeed she is my sister: she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="21"> And he dwelt in the Wilderness of Paran, and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech and Phichol, the chief captain of his host, spoke unto Abraham, saying, "God is with thee in all that thou doest.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9"> And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And the thing which he did displeased the LORD; therefore He slew him also.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, "Remain a widow at thy father's house, until Shelah my son is grown"; for he said, "Lest perhaps he die also, as his brethren did." And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And in process of time, the daughter of Shua, Judah's wife, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="25"> When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, "By the man whose these are, am I with child." And she said, "Discern, I pray thee, whose are these -- the signet, and bracelets, and staff."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And Judah acknowledged them and said, "She hath been more righteous than I, because I gave her not to Shelah my son." And he knew her again no more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And it came to pass in the time of her travail that, behold, twins were in her womb.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8"> And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof. And Pharaoh told them his dream, but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Then spoke the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, "I do remember my faults this day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me under guard in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="29"> Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="34"> Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up a fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6"> And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And he said unto his people, "Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Come on, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply and it come to pass, when there befalleth any war, that they join also unto our enemies and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Therefore they set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew; and they were grieved because of the children of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar and in brick and in all manner of service in the field; all their service wherein they made them serve was with rigor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And he said, "When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women and see them upon the birthstools, if it be a son then ye shall kill him; but if it be a daughter then she shall live."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said unto them, "Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Therefore God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that He made them houses.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took for a wife a daughter of Levi.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And the woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the reeds by the river's brink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And his sister stood afar off to learn what would be done to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river, and her maidens walked along by the riverside; and when she saw the ark among the reeds, she sent her maid to fetch it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And when she had opened it, she saw the child; and behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go." And the maid went and called the child's mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, "Take this child away and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages." And the woman took the child, and nursed it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses [that is, Drawn out], and she said, "Because I drew him out of the water."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens; and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together; and he said to him that did the wrong, "Why smitest thou thy fellow?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And he said, "Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Intendest thou to kill me as thou killed the Egyptian?" And Moses feared and said, "Surely this thing is known."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, "How is it that ye have come so soon today?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And they said, "An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us and watered the flock."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And he said unto his daughters, "And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And Moses was content to dwell with the man; and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom [that is, A stranger there]; for he said, "I have been a stranger in a strange land."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And it came to pass in process of time that the king of Egypt died. And the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried; and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God took heed of them.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the back side of the desert and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> And Moses said, "I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said, "Moses, Moses." And he said, "Here am I."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And He said, "Draw not nigh hither. Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7"> And the men pursued after them on the way to the Jordan unto the fords; and as soon as those who pursued after them had gone out, they shut the gate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And before they lay down, she came up unto them upon the roof,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> and she said unto the men, "I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when ye came out of Egypt, and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites who were on the other side of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you; for the LORD your God, He is God in heaven above and on earth beneath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shown you kindness, that ye will also show kindness unto my father's house, and give me a true token,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14"> And the men answered her, "Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Then she let them down by a cord through the window, for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And she said unto them, "Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers have returned, and afterward may ye go your way."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And the men said unto her, "We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by; and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household home unto thee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless; and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And if thou utter this our business, then we will be free of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And she said, "According unto your words, so be it." And she sent them away, and they departed; and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And they went and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days until the pursuers had returned; and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> So the two men returned and descended from the mountain, and passed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2"> At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, "Make thee sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins [or, Gibeahhaaraloth].</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people who came out of Egypt who were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Now all the people who came out were circumcised; but all the people who were born in the wilderness on the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness till all the people who were men of war, who came out of Egypt, were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD.

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now Jericho was securely shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns; and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And it shall come to pass, when they make a long blast with the ram's horn and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, that all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said unto them, "Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And he said unto the people, "Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD and blew with the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And the armed men went before the priests who blew with the trumpets, and the rearward came after the ark, the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, "Ye shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you shout. Then shall ye shout."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once; and they came into the camp and lodged in the camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually and blew with the trumpets; and the armed men went before them, but the rearward came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And the second day they compassed the city once and returned into the camp. So they did six days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early, about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city in the same manner seven times. Only on that day they compassed the city seven times.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, "Shout! For the LORD hath given you the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And the city shall be accursed, even it and all who are therein, to the LORD. Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And ye, in all ways keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse and trouble it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> But all the silver and gold and vessels of brass and iron are consecrated unto the LORD. They shall come into the treasury of the LORD."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets.

			<VERS vnumber="21"> And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox and sheep and ass, with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> But Joshua had said unto the two men who had spied out the country, "Go into the harlot's house, and bring out from thence the woman and all that she hath, as ye swore unto her."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And the young men who were spies went in and brought Rahab and her father and her mother and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred and left them outside the camp of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And they burned the city with fire and all that was therein. Only the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and of iron they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, "Cursed be the man before the LORD who riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho. He shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame was noised throughout all the country.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing, for Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing; and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven on the east side of Bethel, and spoke unto them, saying, "Go up and view the country." And the men went up and viewed Ai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And they returned to Joshua and said unto him, "Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labor thither, for they are but few."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men, and they fled before the men of Ai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men, for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim and smote them in their going down. Therefore the hearts of the people melted and became as water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And Joshua rent his clothes and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And Joshua said, "Alas, O Lord GOD, why hast Thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us? Would to God we had been content and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> O LORD, what shall I say when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round and cut off our name from the earth. And what wilt Thou do unto Thy great name?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And the LORD said unto Joshua, "Get thee up. Why liest thou thus upon thy face?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them; for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen and dissembled also; and they have put it even among their own stuff.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed. Neither will I be with you any more, unless ye destroy the accursed from among you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Up, sanctify the people and say, `Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, for thus saith the LORD God of Israel: There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel. Thou canst not stand before thine enemies until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes; and it shall be that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof, and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households, and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And it shall be that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burned with fire, he and all that he hath, because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> So Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> and he brought the family of Judah, and he took the family of the Zarhites; and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man, and Zabdi was taken;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> and he brought his household man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah was taken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And Joshua said unto Achan, "My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel and make confession unto Him. And tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And Achan answered Joshua and said, "Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonian garment and two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them and took them; and behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold, and his sons and his daughters, and his oxen and his asses and his sheep, and his tent and all that he had; and they brought them unto the Valley of Achor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And Joshua said, "Why hast thou troubled us? The LORD shall trouble thee this day." And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore the name of that place was called the Valley of Achor [that is, Trouble] unto this day.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> And the LORD said unto Joshua, "Fear not, neither be thou dismayed. Take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai. See, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai and his people and his city and his land.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai; and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away by night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And he commanded them, saying, "Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city. Go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> and I and all the people who are with me will approach unto the city. And it shall come to pass, when they come out against us as at the first, that we will flee before them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> (for they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, `They flee before us, as at the first.' Therefore we will flee before them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Then ye shall rise up from the ambush and seize upon the city, for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire. According to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Joshua therefore sent them forth; and they went to lie in ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua lodged that night among the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And Joshua rose up early in the morning and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And all the people, even the people of war who were with him, went up and drew nigh, and came before the city and pitched camp on the north side of Ai. Now there was a valley between them and Ai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And he took about five thousand men and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city and those lying in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hastened and rose up early; and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed before the plain; but he knew not that there lay an ambush against him behind the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And all the people who were in Ai were called together to pursue after them, and they pursued after Joshua and were drawn away from the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who went not out after Israel; and they left the city open and pursued after Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And the LORD said unto Joshua, "Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai, for I will give it into thine hand." And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand; and they entered into the city and took it, and hastened and set the city on fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way; and the people who fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again and slew the men of Ai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And the others issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side and some on that side. And they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> and the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they had all fallen on the edge of the sword until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai and smote it with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And so it was that all who fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8"> So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets; and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men. And the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="22"> And the three hundred blew the trumpets; and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host; and the host fled to Bethshittah towards Zererah and to the border of Abelmeholah unto Tabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali and out of Asher and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And Gideon sent messengers throughout all Mount Ephraim, saying, "Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and the Jordan." Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and the Jordan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the wine press of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of the Jordan.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="19"> And they said unto him, "Hold thy peace. Lay thine hand upon thy mouth and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And the priest's heart was glad; and he took the ephod and the teraphim and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and their baggage in front of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together and overtook the children of Dan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And they cried unto the children of Dan; and they turned their faces and said unto Micah, "What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And he said, "Ye have taken away my gods which I made and the priest, and ye have gone away. And what have I more? And what is this that ye say unto me, `What aileth thee?'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And the children of Dan said unto him, "Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee and thou lose thy life with the lives of thy household."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And the children of Dan went their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And they took the things which Micah had made and the priest whom he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people who were at quiet and secure; and they smote them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a city and dwelt therein;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> and they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel. However, the name of the city was Laish at the first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> And the children of Dan set up the graven image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of Mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehem in Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Bethlehem in Judah, and was there four whole months.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And her husband arose and went after her to speak friendly unto her and to bring her back, having his servant with him and a couple of asses. And she brought him into her father's house; and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And his father-in-law, the damsel's father, entertained him, and he tarried with him three days; so they ate and drank and lodged there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart; and the damsel's father said unto his son-in-law, "Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And they sat down and ate and drank both of them together; for the damsel's father had said unto the man, "Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And when the man rose up to depart, his father-in-law urged him; therefore he lodged there again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said, "Comfort thine heart, I pray thee." And they tarried until afternoon, and they ate both of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And when the man rose up to depart, he and his concubine and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel's father, said unto him, "Behold, now the day draweth toward evening. I pray you tarry all night. Behold, the day groweth to an end. Lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and tomorrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came opposite Jebus, which is Jerusalem. And there were with him two asses saddled. His concubine also was with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, "Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites and lodge in it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And his master said unto him, "We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger that is not of the children of Israel. We will pass over to Gibeah."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And he said unto his servant, "Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah or in Ramah."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And they turned aside thither to go in and to lodge in Gibeah; and when he went in, he sat down in a street of the city, for there was no man who took them into his house for lodging.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening, who was also of Mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah, but the men of the place were Benjamites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, "Whither goest thou? And from whence comest thou?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And he said unto him, "We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah toward the side of Mount Ephraim; from thence am I. And I went to Bethlehem in Judah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man who receiveth me to his house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses, and there is bread and wine also for me and for thy handmaid and for the young man who is with thy servants. There is no want of any thing."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And the old man said, "Peace be with thee. Howsoever, let all thy wants lie upon me. Only lodge not in the street."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses; and they washed their feet, and ate and drank.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about and beat at the door, and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, "Bring forth the man who came into thine house, that we may know him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them and said unto them, "Nay, my brethren! Nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly! Seeing that this man has come into mine house, do not this folly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Behold, here is my daughter, a maiden, and his concubine. Them I will bring out now, and humble ye them and do with them what seemeth good unto you; but unto this man do not so vile a thing!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> But the men would not hearken to him. So the man took his concubine and brought her forth unto them, and they knew her and abused her all the night until the morning; and when the day began to spring, they let her go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and behold, the woman, his concubine, had fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> And he said unto her, "Up, and let us be going." But none answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up and went unto his place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> And when he had come into his house, he took a knife and laid hold on his concubine and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the regions of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> And it was so, that all who saw it said, "There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt until this day. Consider it, take counsel, and speak your minds."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpah.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) Then said the children of Israel, "Tell us, how was this wickedness?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And the Levite, the husband of the woman who was slain, answered and said, "I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me; and my concubine have they forced, so that she is dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Behold, ye are all children of Israel. Give here your advice and counsel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And all the people arose as one man, saying, "We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18"> And the children of Israel arose and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God and said, "Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin?" And the LORD said, "Judah shall go up first."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And the children of Israel rose up in the morning and encamped against Gibeah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="22"> And the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves and set up again in battle array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, "Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin, my brother?" And the LORD said, "Go up against him."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="27"> And the children of Israel inquired of the LORD (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, "Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin, my brother, or shall I cease?"

			<VERS vnumber="29"> And Israel set liersinwait round about Gibeah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="32"> And the children of Benjamin said, "They are smitten down before us, as at the first." But the children of Israel said, "Let us flee and draw them from the city unto the highways."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="34"> And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore; but they knew not that evil was near them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men; all these drew the sword.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten; for the men of Israel gave way to the Benjamites, because they trusted in the liersinwait whom they had set against Gibeah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> And the liersinwait hastened and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liersinwait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liersinwait that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said, "Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed; for they saw that evil had come upon them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness, but the battle overtook them; and those who came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> Thus they enclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them and trod them down with ease opposite Gibeah toward the sunrising.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men. All these were men of valor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon; and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men, and pursued hard after them unto Gidom and slew two thousand men of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> So all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men who drew the sword. All these were men of valor.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now it came to pass, in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And the name of the man was Elimelech and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And they took themselves wives of the women of Moab: the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth. And they dwelt there about ten years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And Mahlon and Chilion died also, both of them; and the woman was left without her two sons and her husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab how the LORD had visited His people in giving them bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Therefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law, "Go, return each to your mother's house. The LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead and with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband." Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice and wept.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And they said unto her, "Surely we will return with thee unto thy people."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And Naomi said, "Turn back, my daughters. Why will ye go with me? Are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Turn back, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, if I should have a husband also tonight and should also bear sons,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14"> And they lifted up their voice and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth cleaved unto her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And she said, "Behold, thy sister-in-law has gone back unto her people and unto her gods. Return thou after thy sister-in-law."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, "The LORD be with you." And they answered him, "The LORD bless thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Then said Boaz unto his servant who was set over the reapers, "Whose damsel is this?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And the servant who was set over the reapers answered and said, "It is the Moabite damsel who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And she said, `I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.' So she came and hath continued even from the morning until now, except she tarried a little in the house."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11"> And Boaz answered and said unto her, "It hath fully been shown to me all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband, and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy nativity, and hast come unto a people whom thou knewest not heretofore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee from the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou hast come to trust."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then she said, "Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord; for thou hast comforted me, and thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I am not like unto one of thine handmaidens."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And Boaz said unto her, "At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar." And she sat beside the reapers; and he passed to her parched corn, and she ate and was sufficed, and left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And when she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, "Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="17"> So she gleaned in the field until evening, and beat out what she had gleaned; and it was about an ephah of barley.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought it forth and gave to her what she had reserved after she was sufficed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And her mother-in-law said unto her, "Where hast thou gleaned today? And where wroughtest thou? Blessed be he that took notice of thee." And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, "The man's name with whom I wrought today is Boaz."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law, "Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead." And Naomi said unto her, "The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And Ruth the Moabitess said, "He said unto me also, `Thou shalt keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my harvest.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, "It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Then Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her, "My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5"> And she said unto her, "All that thou sayest unto me I will do."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn; and she came softly, and uncovered his feet and laid herself down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid, and turned himself; and behold, a woman lay at his feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And he said, "Who art thou?" And she answered, "I am Ruth, thine handmaid. Spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid, for thou art a near kinsman."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And he said, "Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter; for thou hast shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followed not young men, whether poor or rich.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14"> And she lay at his feet until the morning; and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, "Let it not be known that a woman came unto the floor."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Also he said, "Bring the veil that thou hast upon thee and hold it." And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her; and she went into the city.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Then went Boaz up to the gate and sat himself down there; and behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by, unto whom he said, "Ho, such a one! Turn aside, sit down here." And he turned aside and sat down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, "Sit ye down here." And they sat down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And he said unto the kinsman, "Naomi, who hath come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land which was our brother Elimelech's.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And I thought to advise thee, saying, `Buy it before the inhabitants and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it. But if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it besides thee, and I am after thee.'" And he said, "I will redeem it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Then said Boaz, "What day thou buyest the field from the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And the kinsman said, "I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance. Redeem thou my right for thyself, for I cannot redeem it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Now this was the manner in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was a testimony in Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, "Buy it for thyself." So he drew off his shoe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And Boaz said unto the elders and unto all the people, "Ye are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimelech's and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's from the hand of Naomi.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his place. Ye are witnesses this day."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And all the people who were at the gate and the elders, said, "We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman who hath come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two built the house of Israel; and do thou worthily in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And let thy house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee by this young woman."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife; and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception and she bore a son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And the women said unto Naomi, "Blessed be the LORD, who hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life and a nourisher of thine old age; for thy daughter-in-law who loveth thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And Naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And the women, her neighbors, gave it a name, saying, "There is a son born to Naomi"; and they called his name Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of Mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And he had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters, portions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> But unto Hannah he gave a double portion, for he loved Hannah; but the LORD had shut up her womb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And her adversary also provoked her sorely to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept and did not eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Then said Elkanah her husband to her, "Hannah, why weepest thou? And why eatest thou not? And why is thy heart grieved? Am not I better to thee than ten sons?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk. (Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD and wept sorely.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And she vowed a vow and said, "O LORD of hosts, if Thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of Thine handmaid, and remember me and not forget Thine handmaid, but wilt give unto Thine handmaid a manchild, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli observed her mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And Eli said unto her, "How long wilt thou be drunken? Put away thy wine from thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And Hannah answered and said, "No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Count not thine handmaid as a daughter of Belial, for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Then Eli answered and said, "Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of Him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And she said, "Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight." So the woman went her way and ate, and her countenance was no more sad.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And they rose up in the morning early and worshiped before the LORD, and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Therefore it came to pass, when the time had come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bore a son and called his name Samuel [that is, Asked of God], saying, "Because I have asked him of the LORD."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice and his vow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, "I will not go up until the child is weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD and there abide for ever."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And Elkanah her husband said unto her, "Do what seemeth to thee good. Tarry until thou have weaned him, only the LORD establish His word." So the woman remained, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks and one ephah of flour and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh; and the child was young.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And she said, "Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman who stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> For this child I prayed, and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of Him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD." And he worshiped the LORD there.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And Hannah prayed and said, "My heart rejoiceth in the LORD; mine horn is exalted in the LORD. My mouth is enlarged over mine enemies, because I rejoice in Thy salvation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> There is none holy as the LORD, for there is none besides Thee; neither is there any rock like our God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogance come out of your mouth; for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by Him actions are weighed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> "The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> They that were full have hired out themselves for bread, and they that were hungry ceased hungering, so that the barren hath borne seven, and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> "The LORD killeth and maketh alive; He bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> The LORD maketh poor and maketh rich; He bringeth low and lifteth up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes and to make them inherit the throne of glory. For the pillars of the earth are the LORD'S, and He hath set the world upon them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "He will keep the feet of His saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall He thunder upon them. The LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and He shall give strength unto His king and exalt the horn of His anointed."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child ministered unto the LORD before Eli the priest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And the priests' custom with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And he struck it into the pan or kettle, or caldron or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites who came thither.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Also before they burned the fat, the priest's servant came and said to the man who sacrificed, "Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh from thee, but raw."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And if any man said unto him, "Let them not fail to burn the fat presently and then take as much as thy soul desireth," then he would answer him, "Nay, but thou shalt give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Therefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD, for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, "The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD." And they went unto their own home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how they lay with the women who assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And he said unto them, "Why do ye such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear. Ye make the LORD'S people to transgress.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him. But if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him?" Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favor both with the LORD and also with men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And there came a man of God unto Eli and said unto him, "Thus saith the LORD: `Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to offer upon Mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before Me? And did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire from the children of Israel?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Why kick ye at My sacrifice and at Mine offering which I have commanded in My habitation, and honorest thy sons above Me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel My people?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Therefore the LORD God of Israel saith: `I said indeed that thy house and the house of thy father should walk before Me for ever.' But now the LORD saith, `Be it far from Me; for them that honor Me I will honor, and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Behold, the days come that I will cut off thine arm and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> And thou shalt see an enemy in My habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from Mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes and to grieve thine heart; and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> And this shall be a sign unto thee that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die, both of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> And I will raise Me up a faithful priest who shall do according to that which is in Mine heart and in My mind; and I will build him a sure house, and he shall walk before Mine anointed for ever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> And it shall come to pass that every one that is left in thine house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, "Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread."'"</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was lying down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim so that he could not see,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> and ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD where the ark of God was, and Samuel was lying down to sleep,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> that the LORD called Samuel; and he answered, "Here am I."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6"> And the LORD called yet again, "Samuel." And Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, "Here am I, for thou didst call me." And he answered, "I called not, my son; lie down again."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, "Here am I, for thou didst call me." And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10"> And the LORD came and stood, and called as at other times, "Samuel, Samuel." Then Samuel answered, "Speak, for Thy servant heareth."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And the LORD said to Samuel, "Behold, I will do a thing in Israel at which both the ears of every one who heareth it shall tingle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house. When I begin, I will also make an end;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> for I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth, because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering, for ever."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Then Eli called Samuel and said, "Samuel, my son." And he answered, "Here am I."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And he said, "What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me. God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any word from me of all the things that He said unto thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, "It is the LORD. Let Him do what seemeth to Him good."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched camp beside Ebenezer; and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel; and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines, and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And when the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, "Why hath the LORD smitten us today before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, "What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?" And they understood that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, "God has come into the camp!" And they said, "Woe unto us! For there hath not been such a thing heretofore.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9"> And it was so that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction; and He smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had hemorrhoids in their secret parts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, "They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us to slay us and our people."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said, "Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people." For there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4"> Then said they, "What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him?" They answered, "Five golden hemorrhoids and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all and on your lords.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Therefore ye shall make images of your hemorrhoids and images of your mice that mar the land, and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand from you and from your gods and from your land.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly; and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he. From his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And the asses of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, "Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And he passed through Mount Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they were not; and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And when they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, "Come, and let us return, lest my father leave caring for the asses and take thought for us."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And he said unto him, "Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man. All that he saith cometh surely to pass. Now let us go thither. Perhaps he can show us our way that we should go."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Then said Saul to his servant, "But behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread is spent in our vessels and there is not a present to bring to the man of God. What have we?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And the servant answered Saul again and said, "Behold, I have here at hand a fourth part of a shekel of silver. That will I give to the man of God to tell us our way."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> (Before this in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spoke: "Come, and let us go to the seer"; for he that is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Then said Saul to his servant, "Well said; come, let us go." So they went unto the city where the man of God was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, "Is the seer here?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And they answered them and said, "He is; behold, he is before you. Make haste now, for he came today to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people today on the high place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> As soon as ye have come into the city, ye shall straightway find him before he go up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that are bidden. Now therefore get you up, for about this time ye shall find him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And they went up into the city; and when they had come into the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them to go up to the high place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "Tomorrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over My people Israel, that he may save My people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon My people, because their cry has come unto Me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, "Behold the man whom I spoke to thee of! This same shall reign over My people."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, "Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And Samuel answered Saul and said, "I am the seer. Go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me today, and tomorrow I will let thee go and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them, for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee and on all thy father's house?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And Saul answered and said, "Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then speakest thou so to me?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall, and made them sit in the chiefest place among those who were bidden, who were about thirty persons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And Samuel said unto the cook, "Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, `Set it by thee.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And the cook took up the shoulder and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, "Behold that which is left! Set it before thee and eat; for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, `I have invited the people.'" So Saul ate with Samuel that day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And when they had come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And they arose early. And it came to pass about the dawn of the day that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, "Up, that I may send thee away." And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, "Bid the servant pass on before us." (And he passed on.) "But stand thou still a while, that I may show thee the word of God."</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Then Samuel took a vial of oil and poured it upon his head, and kissed him and said, "Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over His inheritance?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> When thou art departed from me today, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulcher in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, `The asses which thou wentest to seek are found. And lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses and sorroweth for you, saying, "What shall I do for my son?"'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor; and there shall meet thee three men going up to God at Bethel, one carrying three kids and another carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a bottle of wine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And they will salute thee and give thee two loaves of bread, which thou shalt receive from their hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines; and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery and a taboret and a pipe and a harp before them; and they shall prophesy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them and shalt be turned into another man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And let it be, when these signs have come unto thee, that thou do as the occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down unto thee to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings. Seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee and show thee what thou shalt do."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And it was so that, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart; and all those signs came to pass that day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And it came to pass when all who knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, "What is this that has come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And one of the same place answered and said, "But who is their father?" Therefore it became a proverb: "Is Saul also among the prophets?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, "Whither went ye?" And he said, "To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were nowhere, we came to Samuel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And Saul's uncle said, "Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And Saul said unto his uncle, "He told us plainly that the asses were found." But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spoke, he told him not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD at Mizpah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> and said unto the children of Israel, "Thus saith the LORD God of Israel: `I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all kingdoms and from them that oppressed you.'</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="20"> And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken; and when they sought him, he could not be found.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Therefore they inquired of the LORD further if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, "Behold, he hath hid himself among the supplies."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And Samuel said to all the people, "See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?" And all the people shouted and said, "God save the king!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Saul chose for himself three thousand men of Israel, whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and on Mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin; and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, "Let the Hebrews hear!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And all Israel heard it said that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was held in abomination by the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude. And they came up and pitched camp in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people hid themselves in caves and in thickets and in rocks and in high places and in pits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And some of the Hebrews went over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed; but Samuel came not to Gilgal, and the people were scattered from him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And Saul said, "Bring hither a burnt offering to me and peace offerings." And he offered the burnt offering.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And Samuel said, "What hast thou done?" And Saul said, "Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> therefore said I, `The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD.' I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And Samuel said to Saul, "Thou hast done foolishly. Thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God which He commanded thee, for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> But now thy kingdom shall not continue. The LORD hath sought Him a man after His own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over His people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And Samuel arose, and went up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And Saul and Jonathan his son and the people who were present with them abode in Gibeah of Benjamin; but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And the despoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> and another company turned the way to Bethhoron, and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the Valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, "Lest the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen every man his plowshare and his coulter and his ax and his mattock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Yet they had a file for the mattocks and for the coulters and for the forks and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> So it came to pass on the day of battle that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan, but with Saul and with Jonathan his son were they found.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now it came to pass upon a day that Jonathan, the son of Saul, said unto the young man who bore his armor, "Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison that is on the other side." But he told not his father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And Saul tarried in the outermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron. And the people who were with him were about six hundred men,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> and Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD'S priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on one side and a sharp rock on the other side; and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> The forefront of the one was situated northward over against Michmash and the other southward over against Gibeah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, "Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that the LORD will work for us, for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And his armorbearer said unto him, "Do all that is in thine heart. Turn thee; behold, I am with thee, according to thy heart."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Then said Jonathan, "Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will disclose ourselves unto them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> If they say thus unto us, `Tarry until we come to you,' then we will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> But if they say thus, `Come up unto us,' then we will go up; for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand, and this shall be a sign unto us."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And both of them revealed themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines; and the Philistines said, "Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armorbearer, and said, "Come up to us, and we will show you a thing." And Jonathan said unto his armorbearer, "Come up after me, for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armorbearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his armorbearer slew after him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And that first slaughter which Jonathan and his armorbearer made was about twenty men within, as it were, a half acre of land which a yoke of oxen might plow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison and the despoilers also trembled, and the earth quaked; so it was a very great trembling.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Then said Saul unto the people who were with him, "Number now, and see who is gone from us." And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And Saul said unto Ahijah, "Bring hither the ark of God." For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased; and Saul said unto the priest, "Withdraw thine hand."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And Saul and all the people who were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle; and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Moreover the Hebrews who were with the Philistines before that time, who went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves on Mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> So the LORD saved Israel that day, and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And the men of Israel were distressed that day, for Saul had adjured the people, saying, "Cursed be the man who eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies." So none of the people tasted any food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And all they of the land came to a woods, and there was honey upon the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And when the people had come into the woods, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath. Therefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in a honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were enlightened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Then answered one of the people and said, "Thy father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, `Cursed be the man who eateth any food this day.'" And the people were faint.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Then said Jonathan, "My father hath troubled the land. See, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened because I tasted a little of this honey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> How much more, if perhaps the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found? For would there not have been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon; and the people were very faint.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep and oxen and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Then they told Saul, saying, "Behold, the people sin against the LORD in that they eat with the blood." And he said, "Ye have transgressed! Roll a great stone unto me this day."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> And Saul said, "Disperse yourselves among the people and say unto them, `Bring me hither every man his ox and every man his sheep, and slay them here and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood.'" And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> And Saul built an altar unto the LORD; the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> And Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night and despoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them." And they said, "Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee." Then said the priest, "Let us draw near hither unto God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> And Saul asked counsel of God: "Shall I go down after the Philistines? Wilt Thou deliver them into the hand of Israel?" But He answered him not that day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> And Saul said, "Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people, and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> For, as the LORD liveth who saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die." But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Then said he unto all Israel, "Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side." And the people said unto Saul, "Do what seemeth good unto thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, "Give a perfect lot." And Saul and Jonathan were taken, but the people escaped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> And Saul said, "Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son." And Jonathan was taken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what thou hast done." And Jonathan told him and said, "I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and lo, I must die."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> And Saul answered, "God do so and more also; for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> And the people said unto Saul, "Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid! As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he hath wrought with God this day." So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> Then Saul went up from following the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> So Saul took the kingship over Israel and fought against all his enemies on every side: against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines; and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> And he gathered a host and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who despoiled them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan and Ishui and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn, Merab, and the name of the younger, Michal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz; and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> And Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any strong man or any valiant man, he took him unto him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Samuel also said unto Saul, "The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over His people, over Israel. Now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Thus saith the LORD of hosts: `I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he lay in wait for him on the way when he came up from Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Now go and smite Amalek and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And Saul gathered the people together and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and lay in wait in the valley.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And Saul said unto the Kenites, "Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt." So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, which is over against Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep and of the oxen, and of the fatlings and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them; but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "I repent that I have set up Saul to be king, for he has turned back from following Me and hath not performed My commandments." And it grieved Samuel, and he cried unto the LORD all night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, "Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set him up a place, and has gone about and passed on and gone down to Gilgal."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said unto him, "Blessed be thou of the LORD. I have performed the commandment of the LORD."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And Samuel said, "What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And Saul said, "They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God, and the rest we have utterly destroyed."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Then Samuel said unto Saul, "Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night." And he said unto him, "Say on."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And Samuel said, "When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And the LORD sent thee on a journey and said, `Go, and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Why then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst leap upon the spoil and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And Saul said unto Samuel, "Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And Samuel said, "Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, He hath also rejected thee from being king."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And Saul said unto Samuel, "I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD and thy words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and return with me, that I may worship the LORD."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And Samuel said unto Saul, "I will not return with thee; for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> And Samuel said unto him, "The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine, who is better than thou.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for He is not a man, that He should repent."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Then he said, "I have sinned; yet honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> So Samuel turned back after Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Then said Samuel, "Bring ye hither to me Agag, the king of the Amalekites." And Agag came unto him charily; and Agag said, "Surely the bitterness of death is past."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> And Samuel said, "As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women." And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death. Nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul; and the LORD repented that He had made Saul king over Israel.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And the LORD said unto Samuel, "How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? Fill thine horn with oil, and go. I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided Me a king among his sons."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And Samuel said, "How can I go? If Saul hear it, he will kill me." And the LORD said, "Take a heifer with thee, and say, `I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do; and thou shalt anoint unto Me him whom I name unto thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, "Comest thou peaceably?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And he said, "Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice unto the LORD. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice." And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And it came to pass, when they had come, that he looked on Eliab and said, "Surely the LORD'S anointed is before Him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> But the LORD said unto Samuel, "Look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature, because I have refused him; for the LORD seeth not as man seeth. For man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, "Neither hath the LORD chosen this."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, "Neither hath the LORD chosen this."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, "The LORD hath not chosen these."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And Samuel said unto Jesse, "Are here all thy children?" And he said, "There remaineth yet the youngest, and behold, he keepeth the sheep." And Samuel said unto Jesse, "Send and fetch him, for we will not sit down till he come hither."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and altogether of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look upon. And the LORD said, "Arise, anoint him; for this is he."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren; and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And Saul's servants said unto him, "Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Let our lord now command thy servants, who are before thee, to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp; and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And Saul said unto his servants, "Provide me now a man whocan play well, and bring him to me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Then answered one of the servants and said, "Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skillful in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Therefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse and said, "Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And Jesse took an ass laden with bread and a bottle of wine and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And David came to Saul and stood before him; and he loved him greatly, and he became his armorbearer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, "Let David, I pray thee, stand before me, for he hath found favor in my sight."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took a harp and played with his hand; so Saul was refreshed and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now the Philistines gathered together their armies for battle and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched camp between Shochoh and Azekah in Ephesdammim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together and pitched camp by the Valley of Elah, and set up in battle array against the Philistines.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And the Philistines stood on a mountain on one side and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side, and there was a valley between them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And he had greaves of brass upon his legs and a buckler of brass between his shoulders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron; and one bearing a shield went before him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel and said unto them, "Why have ye come out to set up in battle array? Am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? Choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> If he be able to fight with me and to kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then shall ye be our servants and serve us."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And the Philistine said, "I defy the armies of Israel this day! Give me a man, that we may fight together!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah whose name was Jesse and who had eight sons; and Jesse went among men as an old man in the days of Saul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle; and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> but David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And Jesse said unto David his son, "Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> and carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the Valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And David rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper, and took and went as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench as the host was going forth to the fight and was shouting for the battle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> For Israel and the Philistines had set up in battle array, army against army.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran unto the army, and came and saluted his brethren.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words; and David heard them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were sore afraid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And the men of Israel said, "Have ye seen this man who has come up? Surely, to defy Israel has he come up; and it shall be that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, "What shall be done to the man who killeth this Philistine and taketh away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And the people answered him in this manner, saying, "So shall it be done to the man who killeth him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> And Eliab, his eldest brother, heard when he spoke unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David and he said, "Why camest thou down hither? And with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride and the willfulness of thine heart, for thou hast come down that thou mightest see the battle."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> And David said, "What have I now done? Is there not a cause?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> And he turned from him toward another and spoke in the same manner; and the people answered him again in the former manner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> And when the words were heard which David spoke, they recounted them before Saul; and he sent for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> And David said to Saul, "Let no man's heart fail because of him. Thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> And Saul said to David, "Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> And David said unto Saul, "Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="37"> David said moreover, "The LORD who delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear, He will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine." And Saul said unto David, "Go, and the LORD be with thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> And Saul armed David with his armor, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> And David girded his sword upon his armor, and he attempted to go, for he had not tested it. And David said unto Saul, "I cannot go with these, for I have not tested them." And David put them off him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> And he took his staff in his hand, and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a pouch, and his sling was in his hand; and he drew near to the Philistine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David, and the man who bore the shield went before him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> And when the Philistine looked about and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> And the Philistine said unto David, "Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves?" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> And the Philistine said to David, "Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Then said David to the Philistine, "Thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield; but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand.

			<VERS vnumber="47"> And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear; for the battle is the LORD'S, and He will give you into our hands."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> And David put his hand in his bag and took thence a stone, and slung it and smote the Philistine in his forehead, so that the stone sunk into his forehead. And he fell upon his face to the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> Therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines until thou come to the valley and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath and unto Ekron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they despoiled their tents.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, "Abner, whose son is this youth?" And Abner said, "As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> And the king said, "Inquire thou whose son the stripling is."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57"> And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7"> And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as in times past.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> And David swore moreover and said, "Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes, and he saith, `Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved.' But truly as the LORD liveth and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Then said Jonathan unto David, "Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And David said unto Jonathan, "Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat; but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at evening.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> If thy father at all miss me, then say, `David earnestly asked leave of me, that he might run to Bethlehem, his city; for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> If he say thus, `It is well,' thy servant shall have peace; but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant, for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee. Notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And Jonathan said, "Far be it from thee; for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it to thee?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Then said David to Jonathan, "Who shall tell me? Or what if thy father answer thee roughly?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And Jonathan said unto David, "Come, and let us go out into the field." And they went out both of them into the field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And Jonathan said unto David, "By the LORD the God of Israel, when I have sounded out my father about tomorrow any time, or the third day, and behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee and show it to thee,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> the LORD do so and much more to Jonathan. But if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will show it to thee and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace; and the LORD be with thee, as He hath been with my father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And thou shalt not only show me the kindness of the LORD while yet I live, that I die not,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever -- no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, "Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Then Jonathan said to David, "Tomorrow is the new moon, and thou shalt be missed because thy seat will be empty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And behold, I will send a lad, saying, `Go, find the arrows.' If I expressly say unto the lad, `Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee; take them,' then come thou, for there is peace to thee and no hurt, as the LORD liveth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> But if I say thus unto the young man, `Behold, the arrows are beyond thee,' go thy way; for the LORD hath sent thee away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And concerning the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be witness between thee and me for ever."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> So David hid himself in the field; and when the new moon had come, the king sat down to eat meat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And the king sat upon his seat as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall; and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day, for he thought, "Something hath befallen him. He is not clean, surely he is not clean."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty. And Saul said unto Jonathan his son, "Why cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday nor today?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> And Jonathan answered Saul, "David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> And he said, `Let me go, I pray thee, for our family hath a sacrifice in the city, and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there. And now, if I have found favor in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren.' Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, "Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Therefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> And Jonathan answered Saul his father and said unto him, "Why shall he be slain? What hath he done?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him, whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to slay David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no meat the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> And he said unto his lad, "Run, find now the arrows which I shoot." And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> And when the lad had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad and said, "Is not the arrow beyond thee?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> And Jonathan cried after the lad, "Make speed, haste, stay not." And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows and came to his master.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> But the lad knew not anything. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad and said unto him, "Go, carry them to the city."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground and bowed himself three times; and they kissed one another and wept one with another, but David more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> And Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, `The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever.'" And he arose and departed; and Jonathan went into the city.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, "Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, "The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, `Let no man know anything of the business about which I send thee and what I have commanded thee.' And I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Now therefore, what is under thine hand? Give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And the priest answered David and said, "There is no common bread under mine hand; but there is hallowed bread, if at least the young men have kept themselves from women."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And David answered the priest and said unto him, "Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days since I came out; and the vessels of the young men are holy and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> So the priest gave him hallowed bread; for there was no bread there but the showbread that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9"> And the priest said, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the Valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If thou wilt take that, take it; for there is no other save that here." And David said, "There is none like that; give it to me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And the servants of Achish said unto him, "Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, `Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Then said Achish unto his servants, "Lo, ye see the man is mad. Why then have ye brought him to me?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Then they told David, saying, "Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshing floors."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall I go and smite these Philistines?" And the LORD said unto David, "Go and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And David's men said unto him, "Behold, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Then David inquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, "Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> So David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, "God hath delivered him into mine hand, for he is shut in by entering into a town that hath gates and bars."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And David knew that Saul secretly practiced mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, "Bring hither the ephod."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Then said David, "O LORD God of Israel, Thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah to destroy the city for my sake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? Will Saul come down, as Thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech Thee, tell Thy servant." And the LORD said, "He will come down."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Then said David, "Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?" And the LORD said, "They will deliver thee up."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah; and he forbore to go forth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And David abode in the wilderness in strongholds and remained on a mountain in the Wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life; and David was in the Wilderness of Ziph in a wood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And Jonathan, Saul's son, arose and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And he said unto him, "Fear not, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee. And thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And the two made a covenant before the LORD; and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, "Doth not David hide himself with us in strongholds in the wood, on the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And Saul said, "Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there; for it is told me that he dealeth very subtly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you. And it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And they arose and went to Ziph before Saul. But David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David, whereupon he came down to a rock, and abode in the Wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the Wilderness of Maon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain; and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul, for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, "Hasten thee and come, for the Philistines have invaded the land."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Therefore Saul returned from pursuing after David and went against the Philistines. Therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth [that is, The rock of divisions].</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> And David went up from thence and dwelt in strongholds at Engedi.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And it came to pass, when Saul had returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, "Behold, David is in the Wilderness of Engedi."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the Rocks of the Wild Goats.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself, and David and his men remained in the recesses of the cave.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And the men of David said unto him, "Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, `Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee.'" Then David arose and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And it came to pass afterward that David's heart smote him because he had cut off Saul's skirt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And he said unto his men, "The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD'S anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave and went on his way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave and cried after Saul, saying, "My lord the king." And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth and bowed himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And David said to Saul, "Why hearest thou men's words, saying, `Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee today into mine hand in the cave, and some bade me kill thee. But mine eye spared thee, and I said, `I will not put forth mine hand against my lord, for he is the LORD'S anointed.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee; but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> As saith the proverb of the ancients, `Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked.' But mine hand shall not be upon thee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> After whom has the king of Israel come out? After whom dost thou pursue? After a dead dog, after a flea!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee; and see and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, "Is this thy voice, my son David?" And Saul lifted up his voice and wept.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And he said to David, "Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And thou hast shown this day how thou hast dealt well with me; forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killed me not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? Therefore the LORD reward thee good for what thou hast done unto me this day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And David swore unto Saul. And Saul went home, but David and his men got themselves up unto the stronghold.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="25">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose and went down to the Wilderness of Paran.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And there was a man in Maon whose possessions were in Carmel. And the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats; and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Now the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife, Abigail. And she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance; but the man was churlish and evil in his doings, and he was of the house of Caleb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, "Get you up to Carmel and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity: `Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And now I have heard that thou hast shearers. Now thy shepherds who were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there aught missing from them all the while they were in Carmel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Ask thy young men and they will show thee. Therefore let the young men find favor in thine eyes, for we come in a good day. Give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants and to thy son David.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And when David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And Nabal answered David's servants and said, "Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants nowadays who break away every man from his master.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Shall I then take my bread and my water and my slaughter that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men whom I know not from whence they are?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> So David's young men turned their way and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And David said unto his men, "Gird ye on every man his sword." And they girded on every man his sword, and David also girded on his sword. And there went up after David about four hundred men, and two hundred stayed by the supplies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, "Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed at them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> But the men were very good unto us and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything as long as we were occupied with them when we were in the fields.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> They were a wall for us both by night and day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Now therefore, know and consider what thou wilt do, for evil is determined against our master and against all his household. For he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And she said unto her servants, "Go on before me; behold, I come after you." But she told not her husband Nabal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill; and behold, David and his men came down toward her, and she met them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Now David had said, "Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him; and he hath requited me evil for good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> So, and more also, do God unto the enemies of David if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that urinates against the wall."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And when Abigail saw David, she hastened and alighted from the ass, and fell before David on her face and bowed herself to the ground,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> and fell at his feet and said, "Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be; and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal. For as his name is, so is he: Nabal is his name, and folly is with him. But I, thine handmaid, saw not the young men of my lord whom thou didst send.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withheld thee from coming to shed blood and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies and those who seek evil for my lord be as Nabal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men who follow my lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid; for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Yet a man has risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul. But the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall He sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that He hath spoken concerning thee and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> that this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offense of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causelessly or that my lord hath avenged himself. But when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> And David said to Abigail: "Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> And blessed be thy advice and blessed be thou, who hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood and from avenging myself with mine own hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, who hath kept me back from hurting thee, unless thou hadst hastened and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any who urinates against the wall."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> So David received from her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, "Go up in peace to thine house. See, I have hearkened to thy voice and have accepted thy person."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> And Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house like the feast of a king. And Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken; therefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him and he became as a stone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> And it came to pass about ten days after that the LORD smote Nabal, so that he died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, "Blessed be the LORD who hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept His servant from evil; for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head." And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him as wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> And when the servants of David had come to Abigail at Carmel, they spoke unto her, saying, "David sent us unto thee to take thee to him as wife."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> And she arose and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, "Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> And Abigail hastened and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers who went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they were also both of them his wives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was from Gallim.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="26">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And the Ziphites came unto Saul at Gibeah, saying, "Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Then Saul arose and went down to the Wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the Wilderness of Ziph.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And Saul pitched camp on the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the road. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had come indeed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And David arose and came to the place where Saul had pitched camp. And David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host; and Saul lay in the entrenchment, and the people pitched round about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, saying, "Who will go down with me to Saul into the camp?" And Abishai said, "I will go down with thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> So David and Abishai came to the people by night. And behold, Saul lay sleeping within the entrenchment, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster; but Abner and the people lay round about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Then said Abishai to David, "God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day. Now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And David said to Abishai, "Destroy him not, for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD'S anointed and be guiltless?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> David said furthermore, "As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him, or his day shall come to die, or he shall descend into battle and perish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD'S anointed; but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster, and they got away. And no man saw it nor knew it, neither awakened; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen upon them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then David went over to the other side and stood on the top of a hill afar off, a great space being between them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And David cried to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, "Answerest thou not, Abner?" Then Abner answered and said, "Who art thou that criest to the king?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And David said to Abner, "Art not thou a valiant man? And who is like to thee in Israel? Why then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? For there came in one of the people to destroy the king thy lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD'S anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And Saul knew David's voice, and said, "Is this thy voice, my son David?" And David said, "It is my voice, my lord, O king."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And he said, "Why doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? For what have I done, or what evil is in mine hand?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let Him accept an offering; but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD, for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, `Go, serve other gods.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD; for the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Then said Saul, "I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day. Behold, I have played the fool and have erred exceedingly."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And David answered and said, "Behold the king's spear! Let one of the young men come over and fetch it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand today, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD'S anointed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And behold, as thy life was much esteemed this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much esteemed in the eyes of the LORD, and let Him deliver me out of all tribulation."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Then Saul said to David, "Blessed be thou, my son David. Thou shalt both do great things and also shalt still prevail." So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.</VERS>

So shall I escape out of his hand."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men who were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5"> And David said unto Achish, "If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there; for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?"</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="24"> And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hastened and killed it, and took flour and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread thereof.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And she brought it before Saul and before his servants, and they ate. Then they rose up and went away that night.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek, and the Israelites pitched camp by a fountain which is in Jezreel.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> Then said the princes of the Philistines, "What do these Hebrews here?" And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, "Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me to this day?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, "Make this fellow return, that he may go back to his place which thou hast appointed for him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us. For wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? Should it not be with the heads of these men?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, `Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Then Achish called David and said unto him, "Surely, as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me to this day; nevertheless the lords favor thee not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Therefore now return and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And David said unto Achish, "But what have I done? And what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And Achish answered and said to David, "I know that thou art good in my sight as an angel of God. Notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, `He shall not go up with us to the battle.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Therefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants who have come with thee; and as soon as ye be up early in the morning and have light, depart."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> And it came to pass, when David and his men had come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the South and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag and burned it with fire,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> So David and his men came to the city, and behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And David's two wives were taken captive: Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters; but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, "I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod." And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And David inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall I pursue after this troop? Shall I overtake them?" And He answered him, "Pursue, for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the Brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred remained behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the Brook Besor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David and gave him bread, and he ate; and they made him drink water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins; and when he had eaten his spirit came again to him, for he had eaten no bread nor drunk any water three days and three nights.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And David said unto him, "To whom belongest thou, and from whence art thou?" And he said, "I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the border which belongeth to Judah and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="19"> And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil nor any thing that they had taken from them; David recovered all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And David took all the flocks and the herds which they drove before those other cattle, and said, "This is David's spoil."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And David came to the two hundred men who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to remain at the Brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David and to meet the people who were with him. And when David came near to the people, he saluted them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial of those who went with David, and said, "Because they went not with us, we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away and depart."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Then said David, "Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12"> And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="20"> Then Abner looked behind him and said, "Art thou Asahel?" And he answered, "I am."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And Abner said to him, "Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men and take thee his armor." But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And Abner said again to Asahel, "Turn thee aside from following me. Why should I smite thee to the ground? How then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> However, he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner with the rear end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there and died in the same place. And it came to pass that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died, stood still.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner. And the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the Wilderness of Gibeon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together behind Abner and became one troop, and stood on the top of a hill.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Then Abner called to Joab and said, "Shall the sword devour for ever? Knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people to return from following their brethren?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And Joab said, "As God liveth, unless thou had spoken, surely then in the morning the people would have gone up every one from following his brother."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> So Joab blew a trumpet; and all the people stood still and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David; but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5"> and the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And Ishbosheth said to Abner, "Why hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, "Am I a dog's head, who against Judah do show kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me today with a fault concerning this woman?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> God so do to Abner, and more also, unless, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> to translate the kingdom from the house of Saul and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, "Whose land is it?" saying also, "Make thy league with me, and behold, my hand shall be with thee to bring about all Israel unto thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And he said, "Well; I will make a league with thee, but one thing I require of thee, that is: thou shalt not see my face, unless thou first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul's son, saying, "Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And her husband went along with her, weeping behind her, to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, "Go, return." And he returned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, "Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Now then do it; for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, `By the hand of My servant David, I will save My people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin; and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> So Abner came to David at Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And Abner said unto David, "I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth." And David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop and brought in a great spoil with them; but Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> When Joab and all the host that was with him had come, they told Joab, saying, "Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he has gone in peace."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Then Joab came to the king and said, "What hast thou done? Behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And when Joab had come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David knew it not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, so that he died for the blood of Asahel his brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> And afterward when David heard it, he said, "I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Let it rest on the head of Joab and on all his father's house; and let there never fail from the house of Joab one who hath an issue, or who is a leper, or who leaneth on a staff, or who falleth on the sword, or who lacketh bread."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> And David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, "Rend your clothes and gird yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner." And King David himself followed the bier.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> And they buried Abner in Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> And the king lamented over Abner and said, "Died Abner as a fool dieth?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Thy hands were not bound nor thy feet put into fetters. As a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou." And all the people wept again over him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David swore, saying, "So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread or aught else till the sun be down."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them, as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not because of the king that Abner the son of Ner was slain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> And the king said unto his servants, "Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4"> And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up and fled. And it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And they came thither into the midst of the house as though they would have fetched wheat, and they smote him under the fifth rib; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8"> And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David at Hebron, and said to the king, "Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, who sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul and of his seed."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, "As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron; and King David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, that was at Gibeah; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which wasat Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God; and Ahio went before the ark.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps and on psalteries, and on timbrels and on cornets, and on cymbals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And when they came to Nachon's threshing floor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen shook it.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9"> And David was afraid of the LORD that day and said, "How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the City of David, but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months; and the LORD blessed Obededom and all his household.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And it was told King David, saying, "The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God." So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the City of David with gladness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And it was so that, when those who bore the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And as the ark of the LORD came into the City of David, Michal, Saul's daughter, looked through a window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="19"> And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, "How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And David said unto Michal, "It was before the LORD, who chose me before thy father and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel; therefore will I play before the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight; and of the maidservants whom thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be held in honor."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="24"> And the shooters shot from the wall upon thy servants; and some of the king's servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Then David said unto the messenger, "Thus shalt thou say unto Joab: `Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another. Press thy battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it'; and encourage thou him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house; and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, "There were two men in one city, the one rich and the other poor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up. And it grew up together with him and with his children; it ate of his own meat and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And there came a traveler unto the rich man, and he was unwilling to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man who had come unto him, but took the poor man's lamb and dressed it for the man who had come to him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, "As the LORD liveth, the man who hath done this thing shall surely die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing and because he had no pity."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And Nathan said to David, "Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel: `I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> and I gave thee thy master's house and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Why hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in His sight? Thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house, because thou hast despised Me and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "Thus saith the LORD: `Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house; and I will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> For thou did it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And David said unto Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD." And Nathan said unto David, "The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> However, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also who is born unto thee shall surely die."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bore unto David, and it was very sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in and lay all night upon the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise him up from the earth; but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, "Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice. How will he then vex himself if we tell him that the child is dead?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead. Therefore David said unto his servants, "Is the child dead?" And they said, "He is dead."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Then David arose from the earth, and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshiped. Then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him and he ate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Then said his servants unto him, "What thing is this that thou hast done? Thou did fast and weep for the child while it was alive, but when the child was dead, thou did rise and eat bread."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And he said, "While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, `Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her and lay with her. And she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon; and the LORD loved him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and he called his name Jedidiah [that is, Beloved of the Lord], because of the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And Joab sent messengers to David and said, "I have fought against Rabbah and have taken from the city its waters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Now therefore gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it, lest I take the city and it be called after my name."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> And David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight of which was a talent of gold with the precious stones; and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> And he brought forth the people who were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln; and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And it came to pass after this that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And Amnon was so vexed that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin, and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And he said unto him, "Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day? Wilt thou not tell me?" And Amnon said unto him, "I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And Jonadab said unto him, "Lay thee down on thy bed and make thyself sick; and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, `I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it and eat it at her hand.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> So Amnon lay down and made himself sick; and when the king came to see him, Amnon said unto the king, "I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, "Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was lying down. And she took flour and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And she took a pan and poured them out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, "Send out all men from me." And they went out every man from him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And Amnon said unto Tamar, "Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat from thine hand." And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her and said unto her, "Come lie with me, my sister."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And she answered him, "Nay, my brother, do not force me, for no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Do not thou this folly!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? And as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king, for he will not withhold me from thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Nevertheless he would not hearken unto her voice; but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Then Amnon hated her exceedingly, so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, "Arise, be gone!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And she said unto him, "There is no cause. This evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou did unto me." But he would not hearken unto her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Then he called his servant who ministered unto him and said, "Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And she had a garment of divers colors upon her, for with such robes were the king's daughters who were virgins appareled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors that was on her, and laid her hand on her head and went on crying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And Absalom her brother said unto her, "Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? But hold now thy peace, my sister. He is thy brother; regard not this thing." So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But when King David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And Absalom spoke unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And it came to pass after two full years that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim; and Absalom invited all the king's sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And Absalom came to the king and said, "Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And the king said to Absalom, "Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be a burden unto thee." And he pressed him; however he would not go, but blessed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Then said Absalom, "If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us." And the king said unto him, "Why should he go with thee?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> But Absalom pressed him, so that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, "Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you,`Smite Amnon,' then kill him. Fear not. Have not I commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got himself up upon his mule and fled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> And it came to pass, while they were on the way, that tidings came to David, saying, "Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Then the king arose and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> And Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered and said, "Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men, the king's sons, for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> But Absalom fled. And the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there came many people by the way of the hillside behind him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> And Jonadab said unto the king, "Behold, the king's sons come. As thy servant said, so it is."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept; and the king also and all his servants wept very sorely.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> And the soul of King David longed to go forth unto Absalom, for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence, a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And come to the king and speak in this manner unto him." So Joab put the words in her mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, "Help, O king!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And the king said unto her, "What aileth thee?" And she answered, "I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And thy handmaid had two sons, and the two strove together in the field; and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other and slew him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And behold, the whole family has risen against thine handmaid, and they said, `Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also.' And so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall leave to my husband neither name nor remnant upon the earth."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And the king said unto the woman, "Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king, "My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me and on my father's house, and the king and his throne be guiltless."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And the king said, "Whosoever saith aught unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Then said she, "I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the avengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son." And he said, "As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Then the woman said, "Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king." And he said, "Say on."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And the woman said, "Why then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? For the king doth speak this thing as one who is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> For we must needs die, and are as water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person. Yet doth He devise means, that His banished be not expelled from Him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Now therefore, why I have come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king: it is because the people have made me afraid. And thy handmaid said, `I will now speak unto the king. It may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Then thine handmaid said, `The word of my lord the king shall now be comforting; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad. Therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Then the king answered and said unto the woman, "Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee." And the woman said, "Let my lord the king now speak."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And the king said, "Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this?" And the woman answered and said, "As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> To bring about this manner of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing; and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And the king said unto Joab, "Behold now, I have done this thing. Go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king; and Joab said, "Today thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And the king said, "Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face." So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty; from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And when he cut his hair (for it was at every year's end that he cut it, because the hair was heavy on him; therefore he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels according to the king's weight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar; she was a woman of a fair countenance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Therefore Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the king, but he would not come to him; and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Therefore he said unto his servants, "See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire." And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Then Joab arose and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, "Why have thy servants set my field on fire?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> And Absalom answered Joab, "Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, `Come hither, that I may send thee to the king to say, "Why have I come from Geshur? It had been good for me to have been there still!"' Now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> So Joab came to the king and told him. And when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And it came to pass after this that Absalom prepared himself chariots and horses and fifty men to run before him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And Absalom rose up early and stood beside the way of the gate; and it was so that, when any man who had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him and said, "Of what city art thou?" And he said, "Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And Absalom said unto him, "See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed by the king to hear thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Absalom said moreover, "Oh, that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And it was so that, when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand and took him and kissed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And in this manner did Absalom to all Israel who came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, "I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow which I have vowed unto the LORD in Hebron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, `If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And the king said unto him, "Go in peace." So he arose and went to Hebron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, `Absalom reigneth in Hebron.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem who were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong, for the people increased continually with Absalom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And there came a messenger to David, saying, "The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And David said unto all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, "Arise, and let us flee, for we shall not else escape from Absalom. Make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And the king's servants said unto the king, "Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, "Why goest thou also with us? Return to thy place and abide with the king, for thou art a stranger and also an exile.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? Seeing I go whither I may, return thou and take back thy brethren. Mercy and truth be with thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And Ittai answered the king and said, "As the LORD liveth and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And David said to Ittai, "Go, and pass over." And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men and all the little ones who were with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over. The king also himself passed over the Brook Kidron, and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And lo, Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar went up until all the people had passed out of the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And the king said unto Zadok, "Carry back the ark of God into the city. If I shall find favor in the eyes of the LORD, He will bring me back, and show me both it and His habitation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> But if He thus say, `I have no delight in thee,' behold, here am I. Let Him do to me as seemeth good unto Him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> The king said also unto Zadok the priest, "Art not thou a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness until there come word from you to assure me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem; and they tarried there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> And David went up by the ascent of Mount Olivet, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered and went barefoot. And all the people who were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> And one told David, saying, "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom." And David said, "O LORD, I pray Thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> And it came to pass, when David had come to the top of the mount where he worshiped God, that, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> unto whom David said, "If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> but if thou return to the city and say unto Absalom, `I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant,' then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? Therefore it shall be that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me everything that ye can hear."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred bunches of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And the king said unto Ziba, "What meanest thou by these?" And Ziba said, "The asses are for the king's household to ride on, and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And the king said, "And where is thy master's son?" And Ziba said unto the king, "Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said, `Today shall the house of Israel restore to me the kingdom of my father.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Then said the king to Ziba, "Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth." And Ziba said, "I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And when King David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came forth, and cursed constantly as he came.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And he cast stones at David and at all the servants of King David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10"> And the king said, "What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, `Curse David.' Who shall then say, `Why hast thou done so?'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, "Behold, my son, who came forth from my loins, seeketh my life. How much more now may this Benjamite do it? Let him alone and let him curse, for the LORD hath bidden him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and cast dust.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15"> And Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="17"> And Absalom said to Hushai, "Is this thy kindness to thy friend? Why wentest thou not with thy friend?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And Hushai said unto Absalom, "Nay; but whom the LORD and this people and all the men of Israel choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And again, whom should I serve? Should I not serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, "Give counsel among you what we shall do."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, "Go in unto thy father's concubines, whom he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred by thy father. Then shall the hands of all who are with thee be strong."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house, and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counseled in those days, was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, "Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4"> And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Then said Absalom, "Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And when Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom spoke unto him, saying, "Ahithophel hath spoken in this manner. Shall we do according to his word? If not, speak thou."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And Hushai said unto Absalom, "The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> For," said Hushai, "thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place; and it will come to pass, when some of them are overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, `There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt; for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude, and that thou go to battle in thine own person.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground; and of him and of all the men who are with him there shall not be left so much as one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city; and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, "The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel." For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, with the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, "Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and thus have I counseled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Now therefore send quickly and tell David, saying, `Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over, lest the king be swallowed up and all the people who are with him.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel, for they dared not be seen to come into the city; and a maidservant went and told them, and they went and told King David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom; but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, who had a well in his court, whither they went down.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="21"> And it came to pass, after they had departed, that they came up out of the well and went and told King David, and said unto David, "Arise, and pass quickly over the water, for thus hath Ahithophel counseled against you."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="23"> And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose and got him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulcher of his father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab. This Amasa was a man's son whose name was Ithra, an Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> So Israel and Absalom pitched camp in the land of Gilead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And it came to pass, when David had come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, "I will surely go forth with you myself also."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> But the people answered, "Thou shalt not go forth; for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die will they care for us. But now thou art worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is better that thou succor us from the city."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And the king said unto them, "What seemeth to you best I will do." And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, "Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom." And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> So the people went out into the field against Israel. And the battle was in the wood of Ephraim,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David; and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> For the battle there was scattered over the face of all the country; and the woods devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak; and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth, and the mule that was under him went away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And a certain man saw it, and told Joab and said, "Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And Joab said unto the man who told him, "And behold, thou sawest him, and why did thou not smite him there to the ground? And I would have given thee ten shekels of silver and a girdle."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And the man said unto Joab, "Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, `Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life; for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Then said Joab, "I may not tarry thus with thee." And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And ten young men who bore Joab's armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel, for Joab held back the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And they took Absalom and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him; and all Israel fled every one to his tent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the King's Dale, for he said, "I have no son to keep my name in remembrance." And he called the pillar after his own name; and it is called unto this day, Absalom's Place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, "Let me now run and bear the king tidings, how the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And Joab said unto him, "Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day; but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Then said Joab to a Cushite, "Go, tell the king what thou hast seen." And the Cushite bowed himself unto Joab and ran.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, "But come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite." And Joab said, "Why wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> "But howsoever," said he, "let me run." And he said unto him, "Run." Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and outran the Cushite.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And David sat between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man running alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And the watchman cried and told the king. And the king said, "If he be alone, there are tidings in his mouth." And he came apace and drew near.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called unto the gatekeeper and said, "Behold, another man running alone." And the king said, "He also bringeth tidings."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And the watchman said, "I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok." And the king said, "He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> And Ahimaaz called and said unto the king, "All is well." And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king and said, "Blessed be the LORD thy God, who hath delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> And the king said, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" And Ahimaaz answered, "When Joab sent the king's servant and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> And the king said unto him, "Turn aside and stand here." And he turned aside and stood still.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> And behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, "Tidings, my lord the king; for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all those who rose up against thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> And the king said unto the Cushite, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" And the Cushite answered, "The enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept. And as he went, thus he said, "O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!"</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And the people got themselves by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, "O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, "Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants who this day have saved thy life and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives and the lives of thy concubines,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> in that thou lovest thine enemies and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day that thou regardest neither princes nor servants; for this day I perceive that if Absalom had lived and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortingly unto thy servants. For I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night; and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Then the king arose and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, "Behold, the king doth sit in the gate." And all the people came before the king, for Israel had fled every man to his tent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And all the people were in strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he has fled out of the land because of Absalom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore, why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, "Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, `Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house, seeing the speech of all Israel has come to the king, even to his house?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh. Why then are ye the last to bring back the king?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And say ye to Amasa, `Art thou not of my bone and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in place of Joab.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man, so that they sent this word unto the king: "Return thou, and all thy servants."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> So the king returned and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over the Jordan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hastened and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over the Jordan before the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And there went over a ferryboat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king as he was coming over the Jordan,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> and said unto the king, "Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> for thy servant doth know that I have sinned. Therefore, behold, I have come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, "Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD'S anointed?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And David said, "What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? Shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? For do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Therefore the king said unto Shimei, "Thou shalt not die." And the king swore unto him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And it came to pass, when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, "Why wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And he answered, "My lord, O king, my servant deceived me; for thy servant said, `I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon and go to the king,' because thy servant is lame.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king, but my lord the king is as an angel of God. Do therefore what is good in thine eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet did thou set thy servant among those who ate at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> And the king said unto him, "Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, `Thou and Ziba divide the land.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> And Mephibosheth said unto the king, "Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king has come again in peace unto his own house."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over the Jordan with the king to conduct him over the Jordan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old; and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim, for he was a very great man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> And the king said unto Barzillai, "Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> And Barzillai said unto the king, "How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> I am this day fourscore years old, and can I discern between good and evil? Can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="37"> Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham. Let him go over with my lord the king, and do to him what shall seem good unto thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> And the king answered, "Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee. And whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> And all the people went over the Jordan. And when the king had come over, the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned unto his own place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him; and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king and said unto the king, "Why have our brethren, the men of Judah, stolen thee away, and have brought the king and his household and all David's men with him over the Jordan?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, "Because the king is near of kin to us. Why then be ye angry for this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king's cost? Or hath he given us any gift?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, "We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye. Why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?" And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2"> And the king called the Gibeonites and said unto them (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them, but Saul sought to slay them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah)"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> therefore David said unto the Gibeonites: "What shall I do for you? And wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And the Gibeonites said unto him, "We will have no silver nor gold of Saul nor of his house, neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel." And he said, "What ye shall say, that will I do for you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And they answered the king, "The man who consumed us and who devised against us, that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD chose." And the king said, "I will give them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD'S oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth, and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill before the LORD; and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest untilwater dropped upon them out of heaven; and she suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, who had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulcher of Kish his father; and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines; and David waxed faint.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight -- he, being girded with a new sword, thought to slay David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succored him, and smote the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore unto him, saying, "Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And it came to pass after this that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob. Then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, who was of the sons of the giant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And there was yet a battle in Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had on every hand six fingers and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, the brother of David, slew him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now these are the last words of David. David the son of Jesse, the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> "The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me, and His word was on my tongue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me: `He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7"> but the man that shall touch them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite who sat in the chief seat among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite. He lifted up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were there gathered together for battle, and the men of Israel had gone away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> He arose and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand cleaved unto the sword; and the LORD wrought a great victory that day, and the people returned after him only to despoil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop where there was a piece of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> But he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD wrought a great victory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines pitched camp in the Valley of Rephaim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And David was then in a stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And David longed, and said, "Oh that one would give me a drink of the water from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and took it and brought it to David; nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he [Satan] moved David against them to say, "Go, number Israel and Judah."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> For the king said to Joab the captain of the host who was with him, "Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And Joab said unto the king, "Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many so ever they be, a hundredfold, that the eyes of my lord the king may see it. But why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Notwithstanding, the king's word prevailed against Joab and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And they passed over the Jordan and pitched camp in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the valley of Gad and toward Jazer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan and about to Sidon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> and came to the stronghold of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beersheba.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And David's heart smote him after he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done. And now, I beseech Thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of Thy servant, for I have done very foolishly."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> "Go, and say unto David, `Thus saith the LORD: I offer thee three things. Choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> So Gad came to David and told him, and said unto him, "Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? Or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies while they pursue thee? Or shall there be three days' pestilence in thy land? Now advise, and see what answer I shall return to Him that sent me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And David said unto Gad, "I am in a great strait. Let us fall now into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of man."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented of the evil, and said to the angel who destroyed the people, "It is enough: stay now thine hand." And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing place of Araunah the Jebusite.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And David spoke unto the LORD when he saw the angel who smote the people, and said, "Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? Let Thine hand, I pray Thee, be against me and against my father's house."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And Gad came that day to David and said unto him, "Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him; and Araunah went out and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And Araunah said, "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?" And David said, "To buy the threshing floor from thee to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And Araunah said unto David, "Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him. Behold, here are oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, "The LORD thy God accept thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And the king said unto Araunah, "Nay; but I will surely buy it from thee at a price; neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now King David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="29"> And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive tree; the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims and upon the palm trees.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> And the two doors were of fir tree; the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> He built also the House of the Forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was a hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams that lay on fortyfive pillars, fifteen in a row.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows; and light was against light in three ranks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And he made a Porch of Pillars: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits; and the porch was in front of them, and the other pillars and the thick beam were in front of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the Porch of Judgment; and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also a house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken for a wife, like unto this porch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewn stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And above were costly stones, according to the measures of hewn stones and cedars.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And the great court round about was with three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD and for the porch of the house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And King Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill to work all works in brass. And he came to King Solomon and wrought all his work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece; and a line of twelve cubits compassed each of them about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And he made two capitals of molten brass to set upon the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> and nets of checker work and wreaths of chain work for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars, seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And he made the pillars, and two rows with pomegranates round about upon the one network to cover the capitals that were upon the top; and so did he for the other capital.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And the capitals upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network; and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other capital.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar and called the name thereof Jachin [that is, He shall establish], and he set up the left pillar and called the name thereof Boaz [that is, In it is strength].</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And upon the top of the pillars was lily work; so was the work of the pillars finished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other; it was round all about, and his height was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And under the brim of it round about there were buds compassing it, ten to a cubit, compassing the sea round about; the buds were cast in two rows when it was cast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hind parts were inward.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And it was a handbreadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies. It contained two thousand baths.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> And the work of the bases was in this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> and on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims. And upon the ledges there was a base above; and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> And every base had four brazen wheels and plates of brass, and the four corners thereof had supports. Under the laver were molten supports at the side of every addition.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit; but the mouth thereof was round according to the work of the base, a cubit and a half; and also upon the mouth of it were engravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> And under the borders were four wheels, and the axles of the wheels were joined to the base; and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel; their axles and their hubs and their rims and their spokes were all molten.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> And there were four supports to the four corners of one base, and the supports were part of the very base itself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high; and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> For on the plates of the ledges thereof and on the borders thereof he engraved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> After this manner he made the ten bases; all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Then made he ten lavers of brass; each laver contained forty baths, and every laver was four cubits, and upon every one of the ten bases was one laver.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> And he put five bases on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house, and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> And Hiram made the lavers and the shovels and the bowls. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made King Solomon for the house of the LORD:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the two pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> and the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> and one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> and the pots and the shovels and the basins. And all these vessels which Hiram made for King Solomon for the house of the LORD were of bright brass.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many; neither was the weight of the brass found out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, upon which the showbread was;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> and the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side and five on the left before the oracle, with the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> and the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the Most Holy Place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> So was ended all the work that King Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver and the gold and the vessels did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto King Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the City of David, which is Zion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto King Solomon at the feast in the month of Ethanim, which is the eventh month.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle; even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the Most Holy Place, even under the wings of the cherubims.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And they stretched out the staves so that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen from outside; and there they are unto this day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> There was nothing in the ark save the two tablets of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And it came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Then spoke Solomon: "The LORD said that He would dwell in the thick darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> I have surely built Thee a house to dwell in, a settled place for Thee to abide in for ever."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And the king turned his face about and blessed all the congregation of Israel, and all the congregation of Israel were standing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And he said, "Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who spoke with His mouth unto David my father, and hath with His hand fulfilled it, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> `Since the day that I brought forth My people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that My name might be therein; but I chose David to be over My people Israel.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And the LORD said unto David my father, `Whereas it was in thine heart to build a house unto My name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="20"> And the LORD hath performed His word that He spoke; and I have risen up in the place of David my father and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built a house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD which He made with our fathers when He brought them out of the land of Egypt."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> and he said, "LORD God of Israel, there is no God like Thee in heaven above or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with Thy servants who walk before Thee with all their heart,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="26"> And now, O God of Israel, let Thy word, I pray Thee, be verified, which Thou speakest unto Thy servant David my father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> "But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain Thee; how much less this house that I have built?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="64"> The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD; for there he offered burnt offerings and meat offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brazen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings and meat offerings and the fat of the peace offerings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65"> And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entrance of Hamath unto the River of Egypt, before the LORD our God seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4"> For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="28"> And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon, seeing that the young man was industrious, made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> that they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came and spoke unto Rehoboam, saying,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5"> And he said unto them, "Depart yet for three days, then come again to me." And the people departed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And King Rehoboam consulted with the old men who stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, "How do ye advise that I may answer this people?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And they spoke unto him, saying, "If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them and answer them and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they hadgiven him, and consulted with the young men who had grown up with him, and who stood before him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And he said unto them, "What counsel give ye that we may answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, `Make the yoke which thy father put upon us lighter'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And the young men who had grown up with him spoke unto him, saying, "Thus shalt thou speak unto this people who spoke unto thee, saying, `Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us' -- thus shalt thou say unto them: `My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions!'"</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="17"> But as for the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="20"> And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel. There was none who followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah with the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="25"> Then Jeroboam built Shechem in Mount Ephraim and dwelt therein, and went out from thence and built Penuel.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="27"> If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> And this thing became a sin, for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="32"> And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar.

		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Bethel; and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> And he gave a sign the same day, saying, "This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken: Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And it came to pass, when King Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God who had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, "Lay hold on him!" And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in back to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> The altar also was rent and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And the king answered and said unto the man of God, "Entreat now the face of the LORD thy God and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me again." And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored to him again, and became as it was before.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And the king said unto the man of God, "Come home with me and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And the man of God said unto the king, "If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10"> So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel, and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel; the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> And Ahab called Obadiah, who was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10"> As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee; and when they said, `He is not there,' he took an oath from the kingdom and nation that they found thee not.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12"> And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me. But I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORD'S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And now thou sayest, `Go, tell thy lord: "Behold, Elijah is here,"' and he shall slay me!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And Elijah said, "As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself unto him today."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, "Art thou he that troubleth Israel?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And he answered, "I have not troubled Israel, but thou and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed the Baalim.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="20"> So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto Mount Carmel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And Elijah came unto all the people and said, "How long halt ye between two opinions? If the LORD be God, follow Him; but if Baal, then follow him." And the people answered him not a word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Then said Elijah unto the people, "I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD, but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Let them therefore give us two bullocks. And let them choose one bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood and put no fire under it; and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD; and the God that answereth by fire, let Him be God." And all the people answered and said, "It is well spoken."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, "Choose you one bullock for yourselves and dress it first, for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, "O Baal, hear us!" But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And it came to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and said, "Cry aloud, for he is a god! Either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he sleepeth and must be awakened."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> And they cried aloud, and cut themselves according to their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> And Elijah said unto all the people, "Come near unto me." And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, "Israel shall be thy name."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD, and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood and said, "Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> And he said, "Do it the second time." And they did it the second time. And he said, "Do it the third time." And they did it the third time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near and said, "LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that Thou art God in Israel, and that I am Thy servant, and that I have done all these things at Thy word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Hear me, O LORD! Hear me, that this people may know that Thou art the LORD God, and that Thou hast turned their heart back again."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and they said, "The LORD, He is the God! The LORD, He is the God!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> And Elijah said unto them, "Take the prophets of Baal. Let not one of them escape!" And they took them; and Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon and slew them there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> And Elijah said unto Ahab, "Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> and said to his servant, "Go up now, look toward the sea." And he went up and looked, and said, "There is nothing." And he said, "Go again," seven times.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, "Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand." And he said, "Go up, say unto Ahab, `Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> And it came to pass in the meantime, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11"> And He said, "Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD." And behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave. And behold, there came a voice unto him and said, "What doest thou here, Elijah?"</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11"> And the king of Israel answered and said, "Tell him: `Let not him that girdeth on his armor boast himself as he that putteth it off.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And it came to pass, when Benhadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, "Set yourselves in array." And they set themselves in array against the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, "Thus saith the LORD: `Hast thou seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And Ahab said, "By whom?" And he said, "Thus saith the LORD: `Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces.'" Then he said, "Who shall order the battle?" And he answered, "Thou."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two; and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings who helped him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, "There are men coming out of Samaria."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And he said, "Whether they have come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they have come out for war, take them alive."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And they slew every one his man; and the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them; and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the horsemen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And the king of Israel went out and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, "Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="24"> And do this thing: Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their places.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And number thee an army like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse and chariot for chariot; and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they." And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And the children of Israel were numbered and were all present, and went against them; and the children of Israel pitched camp before them like two little flocks of kids, but the Syrians filled the country.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> And there came a man of God, and spoke unto the king of Israel and said, "Thus saith the LORD: `Because the Syrians have said, "The LORD is God of the hills, but He is not God of the valleys," therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> And they pitched camp one opposite the other seven days. And so it was that in the seventh day the battle was joined, and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men who were left. And Benhadad fled and came into the city, into an inner chamber.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> And his servants said unto him, "Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will save thy life."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> So they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel and said, "Thy servant Benhadad saith, `I pray thee, let me live.'" And he said, "Is he yet alive? He is my brother."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Now the men diligently observed whether any thing would come from him, and hastily caught it; and they said, "Thy brother Benhadad." Then he said, "Go ye, bring him." Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> And Benhadad said unto him, "The cities which my father took from thy father I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thyself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria." Then said Ahab, "I will send thee away with this covenant." So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbor in the word of the LORD, "Smite me, I pray thee." And the man refused to smite him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Then said he unto him, "Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee." And as soon as he had departed from him, a lion found him and slew him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Then he found another man and said, "Smite me, I pray thee." And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king; and he said, "Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle.

If by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone." And the king of Israel said unto him, "So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> And he hastened and took the ashes away from his face, and the king of Israel recognized him, that he was of the prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> And he said unto the king, "Thus saith the LORD: `Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.'"</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> And it came to pass after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> And Naboth said to Ahab, "The LORD forbid me that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, "I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers." And he lay down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, "Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?"</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11"> And it came to pass, as they still went on and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And Elisha saw it, and he cried, "My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof!" And he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters and said, "Where is the LORD God of Elijah?" And when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither; and Elisha went over.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And when the sons of the prophets who were in view at Jericho saw him, they said, "The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha." And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And they said unto him, "Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men. Let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master, lest perhaps the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley." And he said, "Ye shall not send."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, "Send." They sent therefore fifty men, and they sought three days but found him not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And when they came again to him (for he tarried at Jericho), he said unto them, "Did I not say unto you, `Go not'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And the men of the city said unto Elisha, "Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth; but the water is nought, and the ground barren."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And he said, "Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein." And they brought it to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there and said, "Thus saith the LORD: `I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And he went up from thence unto Bethel. And as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him and said unto him, "Go up, thou bald head! Go up, thou bald head!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And he turned back and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two shebears out of the wood and tore forty and two children of them.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD, but not like his father and like his mother; for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand rams with the wool.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And King Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time and numbered all Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, "The king of Moab hath rebelled against me. Wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle?" And he said, "I will go up; I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And he said, "Which way shall we go up?" And he answered, "The way through the Wilderness of Edom."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, "Thy servant my husband is dead, and thou knowest that thy servant feared the LORD; and the creditor hath come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And Elisha said unto her, "What shall I do for thee? Tell me, what hast thou in the house?" And she said, "Thine handmaid hath not anything in the house, save a pot of oil."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Then he said, "Go, borrow thee vessels abroad from all thy neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And when thou hast come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8"> And there was a day that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And she said unto her husband, "Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God who passeth by us continually.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a candlestick. And it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And it fell on a day that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber and lay there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And he said to Gehazi his servant, "Call this Shunammite." And when he had called her, she stood before him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And he said unto him, "Say now unto her, `Behold, thou hast shown concern for us with all this care. What is to be done for thee? Wouldest thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the host?'" And she answered, "I dwell among mine own people."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And he said, "What then is to be done for her?" And Gehazi answered, "Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And he said, "Call her." And when he had called her, she stood in the door.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And he said, "About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son." And she said, "Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And when the child was grown, it happened one day that he went out to his father to the reapers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And he said unto his father, "My head, my head." And he said to a lad, "Carry him to his mother."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And when he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="28"> Then she said, "Did I desire a son of my lord? Did I not say, `Do not deceive me'?"</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="35"> Then he returned and walked in the house to and fro, and went up and stretched himself upon him; and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> And he called Gehazi and said, "Call this Shunammite." So he called her. And when she had come in unto him, he said, "Take up thy son."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son and went out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> And Elisha came again to Gilgal; and there was a famine in the land. And the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said unto his servant, "Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="40"> So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out and said, "O thou man of God, there is death in the pot!" And they could not eat thereof.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> But he said, "Then bring meal." And he cast it into the pot and he said, "Pour out for the people, that they may eat." And there was no harm in the pot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, "Give unto the people, that they may eat."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man before his master, and honorable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria. He was also a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And she said unto her mistress, "Would to God my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! For he would heal him of his leprosy."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And one went in and told his lord, saying, "Thus and thus said the maid who is from the land of Israel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And the king of Syria said, "Go now, go; and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel." And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold and ten changes of raiment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, "Now when this letter has come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest cure him of his leprosy."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes and said, "Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to cure a man of his leprosy? Therefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, "Why hast thou rent thy clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, "Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> But Naaman was wroth and went away, and said, "Behold, I thought, `He will surely come out to me, and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and cure the leper.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? May I not wash in them and be clean?" So he turned and went away in a rage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And his servants came near, and spoke unto him and said, "My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? How much rather then, when he saith to thee, `Wash, and be clean'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Then went he down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came and stood before him; and he said, "Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing from thy servant."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> But he said, "As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none." And he urged him to take it, but he refused.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And Naaman said, "Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? For thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon -- when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And he said unto him, "Go in peace." So he departed from him a little way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, "Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian in not receiving at his hands that which he brought; but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him and take something from him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he alighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, "Is all well?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And he said, "All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, `Behold, even now there have come to me from Mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets. Give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver and two changes of garments.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And Naaman said, "Be content, take two talents." And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bore them before him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand and stowed them in the house; and he let the men go, and they departed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> But he went in and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, "From whence comest thou, Gehazi?" And he said, "Thy servant went nowhere."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And he said unto him, "Went not mine heart with thee when the man turned back from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money and to receive garments, and olive yards and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and menservants and maidservants?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed for ever." And he went out from his presence a leper, as white as snow.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> And one said, "Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants." And he answered, "I will go."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> But as one was felling a beam, the ax head fell into the water; and he cried and said, "Alas, master! For it was borrowed!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And the man of God said, "Where fell it?" And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick and cast it in thither, and the iron did swim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Therefore said he, "Take it up to thee." And he put out his hand and took it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, "In such and such a place shall be my camp."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, "Beware that thou pass not such a place, for thither the Syrians are coming down."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And the king of Israel sent to the place of which the man of God told him and warned him, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled by this thing; and he called his servants and said unto them, "Will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And one of his servants said, "None, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And he said, "Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him." And it was told him, saying, "Behold, he is in Dothan."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Therefore sent he thither horses and chariots and a great host, and they came by night and compassed the city about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And when the servant of the man of God had risen early and gone forth, behold, a host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, "Alas, my master! What shall we do?"</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="17"> And Elisha prayed and said, "LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see." And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw; and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD and said, "Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness." And He smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And Elisha said unto them, "This is not the way, neither is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek." But he led them to Samaria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And it came to pass, when they had come into Samaria, that Elisha said, "LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see." And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And the king of Israel said unto Elisha when he saw them, "My father, shall I smite them? Shall I smite them?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And he answered, "Thou shalt not smite them. Wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And he prepared great provision for them; and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.</VERS>

But ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, "See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head? Look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door. Is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him; and he said, "Behold, this evil is from the LORD. Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?"</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> He removed the high places, and broke the images, and cut down the Asherah poles, and broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made; for until those days the children of Israel burned incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> He trusted in the LORD God of Israel, so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any who were before him.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="20"> Thou sayest (but they are but vain words), "I have counsel and strength for the war." Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all who trust in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> But if ye say unto me, "We trust in the LORD our God," is not that He, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, "Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem"?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="25"> Have I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, "Go up against this land and destroy it."'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, "Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language, for we understand it; and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people who are on the wall."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> But Rabshakeh said unto them, "Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? Hath he not sent me to the men who sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language and spoke, saying, "Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Thus saith the king: `Let not Hezekiah deceive you, for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="31"> Hearken not to Hezekiah, for thus saith the king of Assyria: `Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me; and then eat ye every man of his own vine and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live and not die.

			<VERS vnumber="33"> Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Where are the gods of Hamath and of Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? Have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="36"> But the people held their peace and answered him not a word; for the king's commandment was, saying, "Answer him not."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> And it came to pass, when King Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5"> So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And Isaiah said unto them, "Thus shall ye say to your master, `Thus saith the LORD: Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8"> So Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, "Behold, he has come out to fight against thee," he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14"> And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it; and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, "O LORD God of Israel, who dwellest between the cherubims, Thou art the God, even Thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. Thou hast made heaven and earth.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14"> For the Levites left their suburbs and their possessions and came to Judah and Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And he ordained for himself priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And after them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong three years. For three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And Rehoboam took Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David for a wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> who bore him children: Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines (for he took eighteen wives and threescore concubines, and begot twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters);</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> and Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief to be ruler among his brethren, for he thought to make him king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And he dealt wisely, and dispersed some of his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fortified city; and he gave them victuals in abundance. And he desired many wives.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And it came to pass that in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> with twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen; and the people were without number who came with him out of Egypt: the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And he took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam and to the princes of Judah, who were gathered together in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, "Thus saith the LORD: `Ye have forsaken Me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves, and they said, "The LORD is righteous."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, "They have humbled themselves. Therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance, and My wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may know My service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house. He took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> In their stead King Rehoboam made shields of brass and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, who kept the entrance of the king's house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that He would not destroy him altogether; and also in Judah things went well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> So King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned; for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put His name there. And his mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.</VERS>

		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now in the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah began to reign over Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> He reigned three years in Jerusalem. Also his mother's name was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men. Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And Abijah stood up upon Mount Zemaraim, which is in Mount Ephraim, and said, "Hear me, thou Jeroboam and all Israel:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingship over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, hath risen up and hath rebelled against his lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted and could not withstand them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made priests for yourselves in the manner of the nations of other lands, so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken Him; and the priests, who minister unto the LORD are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense. The showbread also set they in order upon the pure table, and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof to burn every evening; for we keep the charge of the LORD our God. But ye have forsaken Him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And behold, God Himself is with us for our captain, and His priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers, for ye shall not prosper."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them; so they were before Judah and the ambush was behind them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind; and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Then the men of Judah gave a shout; and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And the children of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter; so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam and took cities from him: Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah; and the LORD struck him, and he died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begot twenty and two sons and sixteen daughters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And the rest of the acts of Abijah and his ways and his sayings are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> For he took away the altars of the strange gods and the high places, and broke down the images, and cut down the Asherah poles;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> and he commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images; and the kingdom was quiet before him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And he built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest; and he had no war in those years, because the LORD had given him rest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Therefore he said unto Judah, "Let us build these cities and make walls about them, and towers, gates, and bars while the land is yet before us, because we have sought the LORD our God. We have sought Him, and He hath given us rest on every side." So they built and prospered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And Asa had an army of men who bore bucklers and spears out of Judah, three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin who bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand. All these were mighty men of valor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with a host of a thousand thousand and three hundred chariots, and came unto Mareshah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And Asa cried unto the LORD his God and said, "LORD, it is nothing with Thee to help, whether with many or with those who have no power. Help us, O LORD our God, for we rest on Thee, and in Thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, Thou art our God. Let not man prevail against Thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah, and the Ethiopians fled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And Asa and the people who were with him pursued them unto Gerar; and the Ethiopians were overthrown so that they could not recover themselves, for they were destroyed before the LORD and before His host; and they carried away very much spoil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And they smote all the cities round about Gerar, for the fear of the LORD came upon them; and they despoiled all the cities, for there was exceeding much spoil in them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, "Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: The LORD is with you while ye be with Him; and if ye seek Him, He will be found by you; but if ye forsake Him, He will forsake you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest and without law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel and sought Him, He was found by them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And in those times there was no peace to him that went out nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And nation was destroyed by nation, and city by city; for God vexed them with all adversity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak; for your work shall be rewarded."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin and out of the cities which he had taken from Mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD that was before the porch of the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh and out of Simeon; for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And they offered unto the LORD at that time from the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> that whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And they swore unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And all Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they had sworn with all their heart and sought Him with their whole desire, and He was found by them; and the LORD gave them rest round about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen because she had made an idol for Asherah. And Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burned it at the Brook Kidron;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> but the high places were not taken away out of Israel. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated: silver and gold and vessels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And there was no more war until the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah and built Ramah, with the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasuries of the house of the LORD and from the king's house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, who dwelt at Damascus, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> "There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father. Behold, I have sent thee silver and gold. Go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And Benhadad hearkened unto King Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the storecities of Naphtali.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building Ramah and let his work cease.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Then Asa the king took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timber thereof wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, "Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore has the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, He delivered them into thine hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is perfect toward Him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house, for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And Asa, in the thirty and ninth year of his reign, was diseased in his feet until his disease was exceeding great. Yet in his disease he sought not the LORD, but the physicians.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14"> And they buried him in his own sepulchers, which he had made for himself in the City of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' art; and they made a very great burning for him.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David and sought not unto the Baalim,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5"> Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought Jehoshaphat presents, and he had riches and honor in abundance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD; moreover he took away the high places and Asherah poles out of Judah.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, "Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead?" And he answered him, "I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, "Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD today."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, "Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear?" And they said, "Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> But Jehoshaphat said, "Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides these, that we might inquire of him?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, "There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD; but I hate him, for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil. The same is Micaiah the son of Imla." And Jehoshaphat said, "Let not the king say so!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And the king of Israel called for one of his officers and said, "Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat each of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="13"> And Micaiah said, "As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And when he had come to the king, the king said unto him, "Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear?" And he said, "Go ye up and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And the king said to him, "How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Then he said, "I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And the LORD said, `These have no master. Let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Again Micaiah said, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting upon His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right hand and on His left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And the LORD said, `Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead?' And one spoke saying in this manner, and another saying in that manner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD and said, `I will entice him.' And the LORD said unto him, `How?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And he said, `I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' And the LORD said, `Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail. Go out, and do even so.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek and said, "Which way went the spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And Micaiah said, "Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Then the king of Israel said, "Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king's son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> and say, `Thus saith the king: Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until I return in peace.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And Micaiah said, "If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not the LORD spoken by me." And he said, "Hearken, all ye people."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went to the battle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots who were with him, saying, "Fight ye not with small or great, but only with the king of Israel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> And it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat that they said, "It is the king of Israel." Therefore they compassed about him to fight. But Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> For it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> And a certain man drew a bow at random, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to his chariot man, "Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host, for I am wounded."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7"> And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by his coming to Joram; for when he had come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="8"> So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men who were to come in on the Sabbath, with those who were to go out on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Moreover, Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears and bucklers and shields that had been King David's, which were in the house of God.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14"> Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the host, and said unto them, "Take her forth among the ranks. And whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword." For the priest said, "Slay her not in the house of the LORD."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6"> And the king called for Jehoiada the chief priest and said unto him, "Why hast thou not required the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses, the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon the Baalim.</VERS>

Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD; and they hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5"> Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together and made them captains over thousands and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin. And he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, who could handle spear and shield.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> But there came a man of God to him, saying, "O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee, for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14"> Now it came to pass, after Amaziah had come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them and burned incense unto them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and He sent unto him a prophet, who said unto him, "Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And it came to pass as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, "Art thou made the king's counsel? Forbear! Why should thou be smitten?" Then the prophet forbore and said, "I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this and hast not hearkened unto my counsel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, "Come, let us look one another in the face."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="19"> Thou sayest, `Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites,' and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast. Abide now at home. Why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou and Judah with thee?"</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="17"> Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD. So they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="34"> But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings.

			<VERS vnumber="35"> And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="30">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem to keep the Passover unto the LORD God of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> For the king had taken counsel with his princes and all the congregation in Jerusalem to keep the Passover in the second month.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together at Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem; for they had not done it for a long time in such manner as it was written.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> So the couriers went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, "Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and He will return to the remnant of you that have escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And be not ye like your fathers and like your brethren who trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, so that He therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the LORD and enter into His sanctuary, which He hath sanctified for ever; and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of His wrath may turn away from you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before those who lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land; for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away His face from you if ye return unto Him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> So the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun; but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Nevertheless some from Asher and Manasseh and from Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Also the hand of God was in Judah, to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of the LORD.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14"> And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away and cast them into the Brook Kidron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Then they killed the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month; and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And they stood in their place according to their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood which they received from the hand of the Levites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> For there were many in the congregation who were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the Passover lambs for every one who was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> For a multitude of the people, even many from Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, "The good LORD pardon every one</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> who prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And the children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And Hezekiah spoke comfortingly unto all the Levites who taught the good knowledge of the LORD; and they ate throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And the whole assembly took counsel to keep another seven days, and they kept another seven days with gladness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep, and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep; and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers who came out of the land of Israel and who dwelt in Judah rejoiced.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, there was not the like in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Then the priests, the Levites, arose and blessed the people; and their voice was heard and their prayer came up to His holy dwelling place, even unto heaven.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke the images in pieces, and cut down the Asherah poles, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And Hezekiah appointed the watches of the priests and the Levites according to their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="16"> And his servants spoke yet more against the LORD God and against his servant Hezekiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> He wrote also letters to rail at the LORD God of Israel and to speak against Him, saying, "As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall to frighten them and to trouble them, that they might take the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And for this cause Hezekiah the king and the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And the LORD sent an angel who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he had come into the house of his god, those who came forth from his own loins slew him there with the sword.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death, and prayed unto the LORD; and He spoke unto him, and He gave him a sign.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him, for his heart was lifted up. Therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Notwithstanding, Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the rath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor; and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for recious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> storehouses also for the increase of corn and wine and oil, and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Moreover he provided for himself cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much substance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the City of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Howbeit, in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him to try him, that He might know all that was in his heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchers of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for the Baalim, and made Asherah poles, and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, "In Jerusalem shall My name be for ever."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom; also he observed omens, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with mediums and with wizards. He wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke Him to anger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, "In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put My name for ever;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers, so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err and to do worse than the heathen whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And the LORD spoke to Manasseh and to his people, but they would not hearken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Therefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> and prayed unto Him; and He was entreated by him and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD, He was God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Now after this he built a wall outside the City of David on the west side of Gihon in the valley, even to the entrance at the Fish Gate, and it compassed about Ophel; and he raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fortified cities of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And he took away the strange gods and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places, but unto the LORD their God only.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> His prayer also and how God was entreated by him, and all his sins and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places and set up Asherah poles and graven images before he was humbled, behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house; and Amon his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father; for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made and served them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And he humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> But the people of the land slew all those who had conspired against King Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="34">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand nor to the left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, and the Asherah poles, and the carved images, and the molten images.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And they broke down the altars of the Baalim in his presence, and the sun images that were on high above them he cut down; and the Asherah poles and the carved images and the molten images he broke in pieces, and made dust of them and strewed it upon the graves of those who had sacrificed unto them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And he burned the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And so did he in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And when he had broken down the altars and the Asherah poles, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites who kept the doors had gathered from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And they put it in the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of the LORD; and they gave it to the workmen who wrought in the house of the LORD to repair and mend the house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Even to the artificers and builders they gave it to buy hewn stone and timber for couplings and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And the men did the work faithfully. And the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah the Levites, of the sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to move it forward, and others of the Levites, all who had skill with instruments of music.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all who wrought the work in any manner of service; and of the Levites there were scribes and officers and doorkeepers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, "I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD." And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And Shaphan carried the book to the king and brought the king word back again, saying, "All that was committed to thy servants, they do it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and to the hand of the workmen."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, "Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book." And Shaphan read it before the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> "Go, inquire of the LORD for me, and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do according to all that is written in this book."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And Hilkiah and those whom the king had appointed went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college), and they spoke to her to that effect.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And she answered them, "Thus saith the LORD God of Israel: Tell ye the man who sent you to Me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> `Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> because they have forsaken Me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands. Therefore My wrath shall be poured out upon this place and shall not be quenched.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, `Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God when thou heardest His words against this place and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbled thyself before Me, and didst rend thy clothes and weep before Me, I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place and upon the inhabitants of the same.'" So they brought the king word again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests and the Levites, and all the people, great and small; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD to walk after the LORD, and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes, with all his heart and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> And he caused all who were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all who were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Moreover Josiah kept a Passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem; and they killed the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> and said unto the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy unto the LORD, "Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, built. It shall not be a burden upon your shoulders. Serve now the LORD your God and His people Israel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> and prepare yourselves according to the houses of your fathers by your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel and according to the writing of Solomon his son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people and according to the division of the families of the Levites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> So kill the Passover lamb, and sanctify yourselves and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And Josiah gave to the people lambs and kids from the flock, all for the Passover offerings for all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks; these were from the king's substance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for Passover offerings five thousand small cattle and five hundred oxen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And they killed the Passover lamb, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people to offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the Book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And they roasted the Passover lamb with fire according to the ordinance; but the other holy offerings boiled they in pots and in caldrons and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And afterward they made ready for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were busied in offering burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And the singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place, according to the commandment of David and Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun the king's seer. And the doorkeepers waited at every gate; they needed not depart from their service, for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day to keep the Passover and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of King Josiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And the children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And there was no Passover like to that kept in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept, and the priests and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this Passover kept.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates; and Josiah went out against him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, "What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war; for God commanded me to make haste. Forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that He destroy thee not."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the Valley of Megiddo.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And the archers shot at King Josiah; and the king said to his servants, "Take me away, for I am sorely wounded."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> His servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had, and they brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchers of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah. And all the singing men and the singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel; and behold, they are written in the lamentations.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="22"> For I was ashamed to request of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy on the way, because we had spoken unto the king, saying, "The hand of our God is upon all those for good who seek Him, but His power and His wrath is against all those who forsake Him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> So we fasted and besought our God for this; and He was entreated by us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests --Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them --</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> and weighed unto them the silver and the gold and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king and his counselors and his lords and all Israel there present had offered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents, and of gold a hundred talents;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> also twenty basins of gold of a thousand drams, and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> And I said unto them, "Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Watch ye, and keep them until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> So the priests and the Levites took the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go unto Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was upon us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from such as lay in wait by the way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> And we came to Jerusalem, and stayed there three days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Now on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas, and with them were the Levites, Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> By number and by weight of every one, the weight of all was written down at that time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Also the children of those who had been carried away, who had come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel: twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve hegoats for a sin offering; all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side of the river; and they furthered the people and the house of God.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, "The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> For they have taken their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands; yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10"> "And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken Thy commandments,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children; for the people wept very sorely.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6"> Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib. And when he came thither, he ate no bread nor drank water, for he mourned because of the transgression of those who had been carried away.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4"> And it came to pass when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him; and I took up the wine and gave it unto the king. Now I had not before been sad in his presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Therefore the king said unto me, "Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? This is nothing else but sorrow of heart." Then I was very sore afraid,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> and said unto the king, "Let the king live for ever. Why should not my countenance be sad when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchers, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Then the king said unto me, "For what dost thou make request?" So I prayed to the God of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And I said unto the king, "If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favor in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah,unto the city of my fathers' sepulchers, that I may build it."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18"> Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me, as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, "Let us rise up and build." So they strengthened their hands for this good work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian heard it, they laughed us to scorn and despised us, and said, "What is this thing that ye do? Will ye rebel against the king?"</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, "Indeed that which they build, if a fox go up, even he shall break down their stone wall."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7"> But it came to pass that when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabians and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were being rebuilt, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> and conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem and to hinder it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="13"> Therefore set I men in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places; I even set the people by families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="22"> Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, "Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labor in the day."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us, put off our clothes, except that every one put them off for washing.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> For there were those who said, "We, our sons and our daughters are many; therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat and live."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> There were some also who said, "We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn because of the dearth."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> There were also those who said, "We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children; and lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already; neither is it in our power to redeem them, for other men have our lands and vineyards."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles and the rulers and said unto them, "Ye exact usury, every one from his brother." And I set a great assembly against them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And I said unto them, "We, according to our ability, have redeemed our brethren the Jews who were sold unto the heathen. And will ye even sell your brethren? Or shall they be sold unto us?" Then they held their peace, and found nothing to answer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Also I said, "It is not good what ye do. Ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen, our enemies?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> I likewise, and my brethren and my servants, might exact from them money and corn; I pray you, let us leave off this usury.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Restore, I pray you, to them even this day their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money and of the corn, the wine, and the oil that ye exact from them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Then said they, "We will restore them, and will require nothing of them. So will we do as thou sayest." Then I called the priests and took an oath from them, that they should do according to this promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Also I shook my lap, and said, "So God shake out every man from his house and from his labor who performeth not this promise; eventhus be he shaken out and emptied." And all the congregation said, "Amen," and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king (that is, twelve years), I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> But the former governors who had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken from them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver. Yea, even their servants ruled over the people, but so did I not, because of the fear of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land; and all my servants were gathered thither for the work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Moreover there were at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, besides those who came unto us from among the heathen who are about us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days, a store of all sorts of wine; yet for all this I required not the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now it came to pass, when Sanballat and Tobiah and Geshem the Arabian and the rest of our enemies heard that I had built the wall and that there was no breach left therein (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates),</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, "Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono." But they thought to do me mischief.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And I sent messengers unto them, saying, "I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down. Why should the work cease, whilst I leave it and come down to you?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Yet they sent unto me four times in this manner, and I answered them in the same manner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Then Sanballat sent his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> wherein was written: "It is reported among the heathen, and Geshem saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king according to these words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, `There is a king in Judah!' And now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Then I sent unto him, saying, "There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> For they all made us afraid, saying, "Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done." Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, "Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple; for they will come to slay thee, yea, in the night will they come to slay thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And I said, "Should such a man as I flee? And who is there that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And lo, I perceived that God had not sent him, but that he pronounced this prophecy against me; for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have cause for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> My God, think Thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who would have put me in fear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month of Elul, in fifty and two days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And it came to pass that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen who were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought by our God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now it came to pass, when the wall was built and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem, for he was a faithful man and feared God above many.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And I said unto them, "Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors and bar them. And appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be opposite his house."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Now the city was large and great, but the people were few therein, and the houses were not built.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles and the rulers and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of those who came up at the first, and found written therein:</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the Water Gate; and they spoke unto Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> And he read therein before the street that was before the Water Gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women and those who could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the Book of the Law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood which they had made for the purpose. And beside him stood Mattithiah and Shema and Anaiah, and Urijah and Hilkiah and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah and Mishael and Malchijah, and Hashum and Hashbadana,Zechariah and Meshullam.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people (for he was above all the people), and when he opened it all the people stood up.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7"> Also Jeshua and Bani and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law; and the people stood in their place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> So they read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly, and gave the sense and caused them to understand the reading.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And Nehemiah, who is the governor, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites who taught the people, said unto all the people, "This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep." For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> On that day they read in the Book of Moses in the audience of the people, and therein was found written that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God, ever,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them. However that be, our God turned the curse into a blessing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where previously they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense and the vessels and the tithes of the corn, the new wine and the oil, which were commanded to be given to the Levites and the singers and the gatekeepers, and the offerings of the priests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> But in all this time I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I came unto the king, and after certain days I obtained leave from the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And I came to Jerusalem and learned of the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And it grieved me sore; therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers; and thither I brought back the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And I perceived that the portions for the Levites had not been given them; for the Levites and the singers who did the work had fled every one to his field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Then I contended with the rulers and said, "Why is the house of God forsaken?" And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the storehouses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And I made treasurers over the storehouses: Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God and for the offices thereof.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> In those days I saw in Judah some treading of wine presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves and loading them on asses, as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. And I testified against them as to the day wherein they sold victuals.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought fish and all manner of wares, and sold on the Sabbath unto the children of Judah and in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Then I contended with the nobles of Judah and said unto them, "What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the Sabbath day?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us and upon this city? Yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the Sabbath."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And it came to pass, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, that I commanded that the gates should be shut,and charged that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath; and some of my servants I set at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the Sabbath day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Then I testified against them and said unto them, "Why lodge ye about the wall? If ye do so again, I will lay hands on you." From that time forth they came no more on the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of Thy mercy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> In those days also I saw Jews who had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And I contended with them and cursed them, and smote certain of them and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, "Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons or for yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did women from other lands cause to sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying foreign wives?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I chased him from me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Thus I cleansed them from all strangers, and appointed the watches of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> and for the wood offering at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> in the third year of his reign he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants. The power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces being before him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even a hundred and fourscore days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And when these days had passed, the king made a feast unto all the people who were present in the palace at Shushan, both unto great and small, for seven days in the court of the garden of the king's palace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> There were white, green, and blue hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings, and pillars of marble. The beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And they gave them drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being diverse one from another) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And the drinking was according to the law. None did compel, for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they should do according to every man's pleasure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Also, Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains who served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> to bring Vashti the queen before the king, with the crown royal, to show the people and the princes her beauty; for she was fair to look on.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> But the queen, Vashti, refused to come at the king's commandment brought by his chamberlains. Therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then the king said to the wise men who knew the times (for so was the king's manner toward all who knew law and judgment;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> and the next unto him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face and who sat first in the kingdom):</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> "What shall we do unto Queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of King Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And Memucan answered before the king and the princes: "Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, `King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, who have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another who is better than she.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire (for it is great), all the wives shall give to their husbands honor, both to great and small."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And the saying pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people in their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Then said the king's servants who ministered unto him, "Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto the palace at Shushan, to the house of the women unto the custody of Hegai the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And let the maiden who pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti." And the thing pleased the king, and he did so.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Now in the palace at Shushan there was a certain Jew whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And he brought up Hadassah (that is, Esther), his uncle's daughter; for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid wasfair and beautiful, whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree were heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto the palace at Shushan under the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house into the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens who were meet to be given to her out of the king's house; and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place in the house of the women.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Esther had not shown her people nor her kindred, for Mordecai had charged her that she should not show it.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="12"> Now when every maid's turn had come to go in to King Ahasuerus, after she had been twelve months according to the manner of the women (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors and with other things for the purifying of the women),</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15"> Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, had come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked upon her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> So Esther was taken unto King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts according to the state of the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat at the king's gate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Esther had not yet shown her kindred nor her people, as Mordecai had charged her, for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai as when she was brought up by him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> In those days, while Mordecai sat at the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those who kept the door, were wroth and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen, and Esther informed the king thereof in Mordecai's name.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> After these things did King Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes who were with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And all the king's servants who were in the king's gate bowed and reverenced Haman, for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Then the king's servants, who were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, "Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily unto him and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And he scorned to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had shown him the people of Mordecai. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> In the first month, that is, the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (that is, the lot) before Haman, from day to day and from month to month to the twelfth month, that is, the month of Adar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And Haman said unto King Ahasuerus, "There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people, neither keep they the king's laws.

			<VERS vnumber="11"> And the king said unto Haman, "The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors who were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people in their language. In the name of King Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish all Jews, both young and old, little children and women in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to take the spoil of them for plunder.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> The copy of the writing, to be given for a commandment in every province, was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in the palace of Shushan. And the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Shushan was perplexed.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city and cried with a loud and a bitter cry,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> And in every province whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting and weeping and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it to her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him; but he received it not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the king's chamberlains whom he had appointed to attend her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was and why it was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city which was before the king's gate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Also he gave him the copy of the written decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther and to explain it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Again Esther spoke unto Hathach, and gave him a commandment unto Mordecai:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces do know that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court who is not called, there is one law of his: to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter, that he may live. But I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then Mordecai commanded them to answer Esther: "Think not concerning thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house any more than all the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there arise respite and deliverance to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed. And who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "Go, gather together all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me; and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. I also and my maidens will fast likewise. And so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now it came to pass on the third day that Esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the king's house, opposite the king's house; and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, opposite the gate of the house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther drew near and touched the top of the scepter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Then said the king unto her, "What wish thou, Queen Esther? And what is thy request? It shall be even given thee, to the half of the kingdom."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And Esther answered, "If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Then the king said, "Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said." So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, "What is thy petition? And it shall be granted thee. And what is thy request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Then answered Esther and said, "My petition and my request is:</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9"> Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Nevertheless Haman refrained himself; and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And Haman told them of the glory of his riches and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Haman said moreover, "Yea, Esther the queen let no man but myself come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared, and tomorrow am I invited unto her also with the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, "Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and tomorrow speak thou unto the king, that Mordecai may be hanged thereon. Then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet." And the thing pleased Haman, and he caused the gallows to be made.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> On that night the king could not sleep; and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles, and they were read before the king.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4"> And the king said, "Who is in the court?" Now Haman had come into the outer court of the king's house to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And the king's servants said unto him, "Behold, Haman standeth in the court." And the king said, "Let him come in."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, "What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor?" Now Haman thought in his heart, "To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And Haman answered the king, "For the man whom the king delighteth to honor,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10"> Then the king said to Haman, "Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew who sitteth at the king's gate. Let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Then Haman took the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, "Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hastened to his house, mourning and having his head covered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, "If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And while they were yet talking with him, the king's chamberlains came and hastened to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4"> For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain and to perish. But if we had been sold as bondmen and bondwomen, I would have held my tongue, although the enemy could not compensate for the king's damage."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Then King Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, "Who is he, and where is he, who dared presume in his heart to do so?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And Esther said, "The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman." Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And the king, arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath, went into the palace garden; and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen, for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Then the king returned from the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine, and Haman had fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then said the king, "Will he force the queen also before me in the house?" As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, "Behold also the gallows fifty cubits high which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman." Then the king said, "Hang him thereon!"</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> On that day did King Ahasuerus give the house of Haman, the Jews' enemy, unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told what he was unto her.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4"> Then the king held out the golden scepter toward Esther. So Esther arose and stood before the king,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> and said, "If it please the king and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king's provinces.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? Or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Then King Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, "Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Write ye also for the Jews, as it pleaseth you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring; for the writing which is written in the king's name and sealed with the king's ring may no man reverse."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month (that is, the month of Sivan), on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded, unto the Jews and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, a hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof and unto every people in their language, and to the Jews according to their writing and according to their language.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now in the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar) on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them (though it was turned to the contrary, so that the Jews had rule over those who hated them),</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="24"> because Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had schemed against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur (that is, the lot) to consume them and to destroy them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that this wicked scheme which Haman devised against the Jews should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Therefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur [that is, Lot]. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter and what had come upon them,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> And the LORD said unto Satan, "Hast thou considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one who feareth God and escheweth evil?

			<VERS vnumber="9"> Then said his wife unto him, "Dost thou still retain thine integrity? Curse God, and die!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> But he said unto her, "Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?" In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came every one from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite.For they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And when they lifted up their eyes afar off and knew him not, they lifted up their voice and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> "Vanity of vanities," saith the Preacher. "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> What profit hath a man from all his labor which he doeth under the sun?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth for ever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteneth to his place where he arose.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> The wind goeth toward the south and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> All things are full of labor; man cannot utter it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done, is that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the sun.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Is there any thing whereof it may be said, "See, this is new"? It hath been already in olden times which were before us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> There is no remembrance of former things, neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come by those that shall come after.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven. This sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> That which is crooked cannot be made straight, and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> I communed with mine own heart, saying, "Lo, I have come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem; yea, my heart had great experience in wisdom and knowledge."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. But I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> For in much wisdom is much grief, and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> I said in mine heart, "Go now, I will test thee with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure." And behold, this also is vanity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> I said of laughter: "It is madness"; and of mirth: "What good doeth it?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine (yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom), and to lay hold on folly, until I might see what was good for the sons of men, which they should do under heaven all the days of their life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> I made me great work, I builded me houses, I planted me vineyards.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house. Also I had great possessions of great and small cattle, above all that were in Jerusalem before me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, and musical instruments, and those of all sorts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> So I was great and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy, for my heart rejoiced in all my labor, and this was my portion from all my labor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Then I turned myself to behold wisdom and madness and folly; for what can the man do that cometh after the king? Even that which hath been already done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly as far as light excelleth darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> The wise man's eyes are in his head, but the fool walketh in darkness. And I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Then I said in my heart, "As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me, and why was I then more wise?" Then I said in my heart, "This also is vanity."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> For there is no more remembrance of the wise for ever than of the fool, since all that now is shall be forgotten in the days to come. And how dieth the wise man? As the fool!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Therefore I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me. For all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Yea, I hated all my labor which I had done under the sun, because I must leave it unto the man who shall be after me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? Yet shall he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have shown myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labor which I had done under the sun.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> For a man may labor in wisdom and in knowledge and in equity; yet to a man who hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> For what hath man for all his labor and for the vexation of his heart wherewith he hath labored under the sun?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> For all his days are sorrows and his travail grief. Yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto more than I?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> For God giveth to a man what is good in His sight: wisdom and knowledge and joy; but to the sinner He giveth travail to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11"> He hath made every thing beautiful in his time. Also He hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice and to do good in his life,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="17"> I said in mine heart, "God shall judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other. Yea, they have all one breath, so that man hath no preeminence above a beast, for all is vanity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> So I returned and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: And behold, the tears of those who were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power, but they had no comforter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Therefore I praised the dead who are already dead more than the living who are yet alive;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> yea, better than both of them is he who hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Again, I considered all travail and every right work for which a man is envied by his neighbor. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> The fool foldeth his hands together and eateth his own flesh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Better is a handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of the spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Again I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> There is one who is alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother, yet there is no end to all his labor. Neither is his eye satisfied with riches; nor saith he, "For whom do I labor and bereave my soul of good?" This is also vanity; yea, it is a sore travail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him that is alone when he falleth, for he hath not another to help him up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Again, if two lie down together, then they have heat, but how can one be warm alone?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threestrand cord is not quickly broken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Better is a poor and wise child, than an old and foolish king who will no more be admonished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> I considered all the living who walk under the sun, with the second child who shall stand up in his stead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them; they also who came after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Guard thy feet when thou goest into the house of God; and be more ready to hear than to make the sacrifice of fools, for they consider not that they do evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter anything before God. For God is in heaven and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> For a dream cometh through a multitude of business, and a fool's voice is known by a multitude of words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it, for He hath no pleasure in fools; pay that which thou hast vowed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Let not thy mouth cause thy flesh to sin, neither say thou before God's angel that the vow was an error. Why should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities. But fear thou God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter; for he that is higher than the highest regardeth, and there are higher than they.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Moreover the profit of the earth is for all; the king himself is served by the field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver, nor he that loveth abundance with increase. This is also vanity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> When goods increase, they are increased who eat them; and what good is there to the owners thereof, except the beholding of them with their eyes?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> The sleep of the laboring man is sweet whether he eat little or much, but the abundance of the rich will not permit him to sleep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely: riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> But those riches perish by evil travail; and when he begetteth a son, there is nothing in his hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> As he came forth from his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labor which he may carry away in his hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And this also is a sore evil: that in all ways as he came, so shall he go. And what profit hath he that hath labored for the wind?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> All his days also he eateth in darkness, and hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Behold that which I have seen: It is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labor that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him; for it is his portion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given power to eat thereof and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labor, this is the gift of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> For he shall not much remember the days of his life, because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> a man to whom God hath given riches, wealth and honor, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not the power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it. This is vanity, and it is an evil disease.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> If a man beget a hundred children and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also that he have no burial, I say that an untimely birth is better than he,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> for he cometh in with vanity and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing. This one hath more rest than the other:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> yea, though he live a thousand years twicetold, yet he hath seen no good. Do not all go to one place?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> For what hath the wise more than the fool? What hath the poor, who knoweth how to walk before the living?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> That which hath been is named already, and it is known what man is; neither may he contend with Him that is mightier than he.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Seeing there are many things that increase vanity, how is man the better?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life being spent as a shadow? For who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> A good name is better than precious ointment, and the day of death than the day of one's birth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting; for that is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Sorrow is better than laughter, for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> For as is the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad, and a bribe destroyeth the heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof, and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry, for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Say not thou, "Why were the former days better than these?" For thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Wisdom is good with an inheritance, and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> For wisdom is a safeguard, as money is a safeguard, but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Consider the work of God; for who can make straight that which He hath made crooked?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider this: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: There is a just man who perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongeth his life in his wickedness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Be not righteous overmuch, neither make thyself overwise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish. Why shouldest thou die before thy time?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from the other withdraw not thine hand. For he that feareth God shall come forth from them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men who are in the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> For there is not a just man upon earth who doeth good and sinneth not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> All this have I tested by wisdom: I said, "I will be wise," but it was far from me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> That which is far off and exceedingly deep" who can find it out?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> I applied mine heart to know and to search and to seek out wisdom and the reason for things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are as bonds. Whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her, but the sinner shall be taken by her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> "Behold, this have I found," saith the Preacher, "counting one by one to find out the account,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: One man among a thousand have I found, but a woman among all those have I not found.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Lo, this only have I found: that God hath made man upright, but they have sought out many inventions."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Who is as the wise man? And who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that because of thy oath to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Be not hasty to go out of his sight. Stand not for an evil cause, for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Where the word of a king is, there is power; and who may say unto him, "What doest thou?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing, and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Because for every purpose there is a time and a judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> For he knoweth not that which shall be; for who can tell him when it shall be?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> There is no man who hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit, neither hath he power in the day of death. And there is no discharge in that war, neither shall wickedness deliver those who are given to it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein a man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done. This is also vanity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with those who fear God, who fear before Him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> But it shall not be well with the wicked; neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow, because he feareth not before God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> There is a vanity which is done upon the earth: that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the works of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the works of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be merry, for that shall abide with him from his labor the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth (for also is there that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes),</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun, because though a man labor to seek it out, yet shall he not find it; yea further, though even a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> For all this I considered in my heart, even that I might declare all this: that the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of God. No man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> All things come alike to all: there is one event that happeneth to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that doth not sacrifice: As is the good, so is the sinner, and he that taketh an oath, as he that feareth an oath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun: that there is one event that happeneth unto all. Yea, also the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live; and after that they go to the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> For him that is joined to all the living there is hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> For the living know that they shall die; but the dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Also their love and their hatred and their envy is now perished; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Let thy garments be always white, and let thy head lack no ointment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which He hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity; for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labor which thou hast done under the sun.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might, for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> For man also knoweth not his time: As the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, so are the sons of men snared in an evil time when it falleth suddenly upon them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> There was a little city and few men within it. And there came a great king against it, and besieged it and built great bulwarks against it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Then said I, "Wisdom is better than strength"; nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroyeth much good.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savor; so doth a little folly in him that hath a reputation for wisdom and honor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> A wise man's heart is at his right hand, but a fool's heart at his left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh along the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to everyone that he is a fool.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> If the ire of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy station; for yielding pacifieth great offenses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun as an error which proceedeth from the ruler:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in lowly places.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh through a hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Whoso removeth out stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> If the ax be blunt and one does not whet the edge, then must he put to it more strength; but wisdom is profitable to direct him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Surely the serpent will bite if not charmed, and a babbler is no better.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious, but the lips of a fool will swallow himself up;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> the beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness, and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> A fool also is full of words: A man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him -- who can tell him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The labor of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child and thy princes feast in the morning!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength and not for drunkenness!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> By much slothfulness the building decayeth, and through idleness of the hands the house leaks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry; but money answereth all things.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth! For the LORD hath spoken: "I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against Me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> The ox knoweth his owner and the ass his master's crib; but Israel doth not know, My people doth not consider."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Ah, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters! They have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they have gone away backward.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Why should ye be stricken anymore? Ye will revolt more and more. The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> From the sole of the foot even unto the head, there is no soundness in it, but wounds and bruises and putrefying sores; they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a shed in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Unless the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto Me?" saith the LORD. "I am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs or of hegoats.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When you come to appear before Me, who hath required this from your hand, to tread My courts?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto Me. The new moons and Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot endure. It is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Your new moons and your appointed feasts My soul hateth; they are a trouble unto Me, I am weary of bearing them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide Mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before Mine eyes. Cease to do evil,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4"> And He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> O house of Jacob, come ye and let us walk in the light of the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> For Thou hast forsaken Thy people, the house of Jacob, because they are replenished from the East, and are soothsayers like the Philistines; and they please themselves with the children of strangers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4"> And Rabshakeh said unto them, "Say ye now to Hezekiah, `Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria: What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> I say, thou sayest (but they are but vain words), "I have counsel and strength for war." Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, "Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="22"> Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="37">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And it came to pass, when King Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14"> And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD and spread it before the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, who dwellest between the cherubims, Thou art the God, even Thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; Thou hast made heaven and earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Incline Thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open Thine eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to reproach the living God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> In truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their countries,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="20"> Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou art the LORD, even Thou only."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, "Thus saith the LORD God of Israel: Whereas thou hast prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15"> Yea, truth faileth, and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey. And the LORD saw it, and it displeased Him that there was no judgment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor; therefore his arm brought salvation unto Him, and his righteousness, it sustained Him.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, "Why dost thou prophesy and say, `Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;</VERS>

Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "And I bought the field from Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed out to him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And I subscribed the evidence and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom and that which was open;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> and I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses who signed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And I charged Baruch before them, saying,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="22"> and hast given them this land which Thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And they came in and possessed it, but they obeyed not Thy voice, neither walked in Thy law: they have done nothing of all that Thou commanded them to do. Therefore Thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Behold the siege ramps! They have come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, who fight against it, because of the sword and of the famine and of the pestilence.

			<VERS vnumber="11"> And it came to pass that when the army of the Chaldeans had broken off from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin to separate himself from thence in the midst of the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And when he was in the Gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Then said Jeremiah, "It is false! I fall not away to the Chaldeans." But he hearkened not to him; so Irijah took Jeremiah and brought him to the princes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Thereupon the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> When Jeremiah had entered into the dungeon and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> then Zedekiah the king sent and took him out; and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, "Is there any word from the LORD?" And Jeremiah said, "There is; for, said He: Thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Moreover Jeremiah said unto King Zedekiah, "How have I offended against thee or against thy servants or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Where are now your prophets who prophesied unto you, saying, `The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land'?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king. Let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee, that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> "Thus saith the LORD: `He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life as a prey, and shall live.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Thus saith the LORD: `This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Therefore the princes said unto the king, "We beseech thee, let this man be put to death; for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words unto them; for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Then Zedekiah the king said, "Behold, he is in your hand; for the king is not he that can do any thing against you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Then they took Jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah, the son of Hammelech, which was in the court of the prison; and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire; so Jeremiah sank in the mire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the Gate of Benjamin),</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10"> Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, "Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he dies."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took from thence old castoff clothes and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, "Put now these old castoff clothes and rotten rags under thine armpits, under the cords." And Jeremiah did so.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Then Zedekiah the king sent and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the principal entry that is in the house of the LORD; and the king said unto Jeremiah, "I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, "If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? And if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> So Zedekiah the king swore secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, "As the LORD liveth, who made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men who seek thy life."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, "Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: `If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, "I am afraid of the Jews who are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> But Jeremiah said, "They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee; so it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shown me:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, `Thy friends have set thee up and have prevailed against thee. Thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they have turned away back.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans. And thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon; and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, "Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee and say unto thee, `Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, also what the king said unto thee; hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death,'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> then thou shalt say unto them, `I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house to die there.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah and asked him, and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him, for the matter was not perceived.</VERS>

So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward and let him go.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the River of Chebar, that the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> On the fifth day of the month (which was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's captivity),</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> the word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the River Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And I looked, and behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself; and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber, out of the midst of the fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And their feet were straight feet, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled like the color of burnished brass.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and all four had their faces and their wings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Their wings were joined one to another. They turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> As for the likeness of their faces, all four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right side, and all four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Thus were their faces. And their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And they went every one straight forward; whither the spirit was to go, they went, and they turned not when they went.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire and like the appearance of lamps; it went up and down among the living creatures, and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And the living creatures ran and returned, like the appearance of a flash of lightning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold, a wheel was upon the earth by each of the living creatures with his four faces.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the color of beryl, and all four had the same likeness; and their appearance and their work was, as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> When they went, they went upon their four sides; and they turned not when they went.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> As for their rims, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rims were full of eyes round about the four.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went; thither was their spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up opposite them, for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up opposite them, for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creatures was as the color of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other; every one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side of their bodies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech as the noise of a host. When they stood, they let down their wings;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> and there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads when they stood and had let down their wings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, with the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness in appearance of a man above upon it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And I saw as the color of amber, with the appearance of fire round about within it. From the appearance of His loins even upward and from the appearance of His loins even downward, I saw, as it were, the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> As the appearance of the rainbow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of One who spoke.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="6"> not to many people of strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee, for they will not hearken unto Me; for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> As an adamant, harder than flint, have I made thy forehead. Fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="18"> When I say unto the wicked, `Thou shalt surely die,' and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his life, the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die. Because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="25"> But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="47"> So he measured the court, a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare, and the altar that was before the house.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Afterward he brought me to the temple and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7"> And there was an enlarging and a winding about still upward to the side chambers; for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house. Therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the middle chamber.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> I saw also the height of the house round about; the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5"> Now the upper chambers were shorter; for the galleries were higher than these -- than the lower and than the middlemost of the building.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts; therefore the upper building was narrowed more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And the wall that was outside opposite the chambers, toward the outer court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits; and lo, those before the temple were a hundred cubits.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15"> Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem and besieged it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God, which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And the king spoke unto Ashpenaz, the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel and of the king's seed and of the princes,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> youths in whom was no blemish, but well favored, and skillful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat and of the wine which he drank, so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Now among these of the children of Judah were: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, Shadrach; and to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank. Therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, "I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink. For why should he see your faces sadder than the youths who are of your sort? Then shall ye make me endanger my head before the king."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> "Test thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days, and let them give us pulse to eat and water to drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths who eat of the portion of the king's meat. And as thou seest, deal with thy servants."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> So he consented to them in this matter, and tested them ten days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate the portion of the king's meat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> As for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And the king communed with them, and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore stood they before the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers who were in all his realm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And Daniel continued even unto the first year of King Cyrus.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled and his sleep departed from him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans to show the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And the king said unto them, "I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in Syriac, "O king, live for ever! Tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, "The thing is gone from me. If ye will not make known unto me the dream with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> But if ye show the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. Therefore show me the dream and the interpretation thereof."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> They answered again and said, "Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> The king answered and said, "I know with certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you; for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time is changed. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> The Chaldeans answered before the king and said, "There is not a man upon the earth who can show the king's matter. Therefore there is no king, lord, or ruler who asked such things of any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is no other who can show it before the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain, and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch, the captain of the king's guard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, "Why is the decree from the king so hasty?" Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Then Daniel went in and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> that they would desire mercies from the God of heaven concerning this secret, that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Daniel answered and said, "Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever, for wisdom and might are His.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And He changeth the times and the seasons; He removeth kings and setteth up kings. He giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> He revealeth the deep and secret things; He knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with Him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> I thank Thee and praise Thee, O Thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of Thee; for Thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said thus unto him: "Destroy not the wise men of Babylon. Bring me in before the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, "I have found a man of the captives of Judah, who will make known unto the king the interpretation."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, "Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Daniel answered in the presence of the king and said, "The secret which the king hath demanded, the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, and the soothsayers cannot show unto the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> But there is a God in heaven who revealeth secrets, and maketh known to King Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream and the visions of thy head upon thy bed are these:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and He that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than anyone living, but for their sakes who shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> "Thou, O king, sawest; and behold, a great image! This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Thou sawest until a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Then were the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them. And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> "This is the dream, and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Thou, O king, art a king of kings; for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath He given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, inasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things; and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potter's clay and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it the strength of the iron, inasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> And as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a Kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the Kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Inasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold, the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter. And the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshiped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet incense unto him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> The king answered unto Daniel and said, "In truth it is, that your God is a God of gods and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> Then the king made Daniel a great man and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits and the breadth thereof six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="3"> Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</VERS>
